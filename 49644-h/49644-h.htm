<blockquote>

<p><b>Motor Matt</b>, a lad who is at home with every variety of motor, and
whose never-failing nerve serves to carry him through difficulties
that would daunt any ordinary young fellow. Because
of his daring as a racer with bicycle, motor-cycle and automobile
he is known as "Mile-a-minute Matt." Motor-boats,
air ships and submarines come naturally in his line, and consequently
he lives in an atmosphere of adventure in following
up his "hobby."</p>

<p><b>Dick Ferral</b>, a young sea dog from Canada, with all a sailor's superstitions,
but in spite of all that a royal chum, ready to stand by
the friend of his choice through thick and thin.</p>

<p><b>Carl Pretzel</b>, a cheerful and rollicking German boy, stout of frame
as well as of heart, who is led by a fortunate accident to link his
fortunes with those of Motor Matt.</p>

<p><b>Hays Jordan</b>, United States consul at Belize. A man of pluck and
determination, who furnishes valuable information about his
friend, Jeremiah Coleman, and even more valuable personal
services during the rescue of Coleman.</p>

<p><b>Jeremiah Coleman</b>, another United States consul who has been
spirited away by Central American revolutionists in the hope of
driving a sharp bargain with the United States Government for
the release of a captured filibuster named James Sixty.</p>

<p><b>Tirzal</b>, a half-breed mahogany-cutter who serves Jordan in the
capacity of spy, and who has been a pilot along the coast.</p>

<p><b>Speake, Gaines and Clackett</b>, part of the crew of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cassidy</b>, mate of the <i>Grampus</i> who, because of a fancied grievance,
takes the wrong trail at the forks of the road. An old friend
whom Matt found to be an enemy and then made a friend again.</p>

<p><b>Abner Fingal</b>, skipper of the notorious schooner, <i>North Star</i>, and
brother of James Sixty, to whose evil nature Motor Matt owes
most of his present troubles.</p>

<p><b>Captain Nemo, Jr.</b>, skipper of the submarine, <i>Grampus</i>, and who
falls victim to a sudden illness. Because of the captain's sickness,

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE DEPTHS.</p>


<p>"Motor Matt!"</p>

<p>"What is it, captain?"</p>

<p>"We are in St. George's Bay, ten miles from the Port
of Belize, British Honduras. Two days ago, while we
were well out in the gulf, I opened the letter containing
the first part of my sealed orders. Those orders, as you
know, sent us to Belize. Before we reach there and
open the envelope containing the rest of our orders, I
think it necessary to test out the <i>Grampus</i> thoroughly.
Unless I am greatly mistaken, the instructions yet to be
read may call for work that will demand the last ounce
of preparation we can give the submarine. I have stopped
the motor, and we are lying motionless on the surface of
the sea. The lead shows that there are two hundred and
twenty-five feet of water under us. The steel shell of
the <i>Grampus</i> is warranted to stand the pressure of water
at that depth. Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, captain."</p>

<p>"Now, Matt, I have been watching you for a long
time, and I believe that you know more about the gasoline
motor than I do, and fully as much about maneuvring
the submarine. We are going to dive to two hundred
and ten feet&mdash;the deepest submersion by far the
<i>Grampus</i> ever made. I wish you to take entire charge.
If you get into difficulties, you must get out of them
again, for I intend to stand by and not put in a word
unless tragedy stares us in the face and you call on me
for advice."</p>

<p>A thrill ran through Motor Matt. The submarine, with
all her complicated equipment, was for a time to be under
his control. This move of Captain Nemo, Jr.'s, perhaps,
was a test for him no less than for the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>For a brief space the young motorist bent his head
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Do you hesitate, Matt?" asked Captain Nemo, Jr.</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," was the calm answer. "I was just
running over in my mind the things necessary to be done
in making such a deep dive. The pressure at two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and ten feet will be terrific. At that depth, the lid
of our hatchway will be supporting a weight of more than
thirty-two tons."</p>

<p>"Exactly," answered the captain, pleased with the way
Matt's mind was going over the work.</p>

<p>"If there happened to be anything wrong with the calculations
of the man who built the <i>Grampus</i>, captain, she
would be smashed like an egg shell."</p>

<p>"We are going to prove his calculations." The captain
seated himself on a low stool. "Gaines is at the motor,
Clackett is at the submerging tanks, Speake has charge
of the storage batteries and compressed air, and Cassidy
is here in the periscope room with us to drive the
<i>Grampus</i> in any direction you desire."</p>

<p>"Dick Ferral is with Gaines," added Matt, "and Carl
Pretzel is with Clackett."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Every man is at his station, and some of the
stations are double manned. Now, then, go ahead."</p>

<p>Matt whirled to a speaking tube.</p>

<p>"We're going to make a record dive, Clackett," he
called into the tube, "and Captain Nemo, Jr., has placed
me in charge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bully for the captain!" came back the voice of
Clackett, echoing weirdly distinct in the periscope room.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" bubbled the exultant tones of Matt's
Dutch chum. "Der king oof der modor poys iss der poy
for me."</p>

<p>"Our submergence will be two hundred and ten feet,"
went on Matt. "You and Carl, Clackett, will put the steel
baulks in place. I'll have Dick and Gaines help you."</p>

<p>Another order was called to the engine room, and presently
there were sounds, forward and aft, which indicated
that the metal props, to further strengthen the steel shell,
were being dropped into their supports.</p>

<p>"Cassidy," said Matt, "see that the double doors of the
hatch are secured."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," answered the mate, darting up the
conning-tower ladder.</p>

<p>"Speake," ordered Matt, through another tube, "see
that the tension indicators are in place."</p>

<p>"Double doors of the hatch secured," reported Cassidy
a moment later.</p>

<p>"Pressure sponsons in place," came rattling through the
tube from Clackett.</p>

<p>"Tension indicators in position," announced Speake.</p>

<p>"Dive at the rate of twelve yards to the minute, Clackett,"
ordered Matt.</p>

<p>A hiss of air, escaping from the ballast tanks as the
water came in, was heard. A tremor ran through the
steel fabric, followed by a gentle downward motion.
Matt kept his eyes on the manometric needles. Twenty
yards, twenty-five, thirty, and forty were indicated. A
pressure of ten pounds to the square centimeter was recorded.</p>

<p>"Plates are beginning to bend, captain," called Speake.</p>

<p>This was not particularly alarming, for the baulks
would settle down to their work.</p>

<p>"Close the bulkhead doors, Dick!" called Matt.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, old ship!" returned Dick, and sounds indicated
that the order was immediately carried out.</p>

<p>"Sixty yards," called Clackett; "sixty-five, seventy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold her so!" cried Matt.</p>

<p>"What is the danger point in the matter of flexion,
captain?" asked Matt, turning to Nemo, Jr., whose gray
head was bowed forward on his hand, while his gleaming
eyes regarded the cool, self-possessed young motorist
with something like admiration.</p>

<p>"Ten millimeters," was the answer.</p>

<p>"We still have a margin of three millimeters and are
at the depth you indicated."</p>

<p>"Bravo! We are five yards from the bottom. Do a
little cruising, Matt. Let us see how the <i>Grampus</i> behaves
at this depth."</p>

<p>The entire shell of the submarine was under an enormous
pressure.</p>

<p>Matt gave the order to start the motor, and the popping
of the engine soon settled into a low hum of perfectly
working cylinders. A forward motion was felt by those
in the submarine.</p>

<p>"Not many people have ever had the novel experience
of navigating the ocean seventy yards below the surface,"
remarked the captain, with a slow smile.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful thing!" exclaimed Matt. "The
<i>Grampus</i> seems equal to any task you set for her, captain."</p>

<p>The air of the periscope room was being exhausted by
the breathing of Matt, Nemo, Jr., and Cassidy. Matt
ordered the bulkhead doors opened, in order that fresh
oxygen might be admitted from the reservoirs. Just before
the doors were opened, Captain Nemo, Jr.'s face
had suddenly paled, and he had swayed on his seat,
throwing a hand to his chest.</p>

<p>"You can't stand this, captain!" exclaimed Matt, jumping
to the captain's side. "Hadn't we better ascend?"</p>

<p>The captain collected himself quickly and waved the
youth away.</p>

<p>"Never mind me, my lad," he answered. "I feel better,
now that a little fresh oxygen is coming in to us.
Go on with your maneuvring."</p>

<p>All was silent in the submarine, save for the croon of
the engine, running as sweetly as any Matt had ever
heard. Aside from a faint oppression in the chest and
a low ringing in the ears, the <i>Grampus</i> might have been
cruising on the surface, so far as her passengers could
know.</p>

<p>Cassidy was at the wheel, steering, his passive eyes
on the compass.</p>

<p>Matt turned away from the manometer with a remark
on his lips, but before the words could be spoken there
was a shock, and the submarine shivered and stopped
dead.</p>

<p>"Shiminy grickets!" whooped the voice of Carl. "Ve
must haf run indo vone oof der moundains in der sea."</p>

<p>"Full speed astern, Gaines," cried Matt.</p>

<p>The blades of the propeller revolved fiercely. The
steel hull shook and tugged, but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>Captain Nemo, Jr., sat quietly in his seat and never
offered a suggestion. His steady eyes were on Motor
Matt.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys realized that they were in
a terrible predicament. Suppose they were hopelessly entangled
in the ocean's depths? Suppose there was no
escape for them, and the shell of the <i>Grampus</i> was to be
their tomb?</p>

<p>These reflections did not shake the lad's nerve. His
face whitened a little, but a resolute light gleamed in his
gray eyes.</p>

<p>"How are the bow plates, Speake?" he demanded
through one of the tubes.</p>

<p>Speake was in the torpedo room.</p>

<p>"Right as a trivet!" answered Speake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>After five minutes of violent and useless churning of
the screw, Matt turned to Cassidy. The mate, grave-faced
and anxious, was looking at him and waiting for
orders.</p>

<p>"Rig the electric projector, Cassidy," said Matt calmly.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied the mate.</p>

<p>When the little searchlight was in position, a gleam
was thrown through one of the forward lunettes out
over the bow of the <i>Grampus</i>. Matt, feeling keenly the
weight of responsibility that rested on his shoulders,
mounted the iron ladder to the conning tower and looked
through one of the small windows.</p>

<p>To his intense astonishment he found the bottom of
the sea pervaded with a faintly luminous light, perhaps
due to some phosphorescence given off by the marine
growth. Through this glow traveled the brighter gleam
of the searchlight.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i> was lying in a dense forest of nodding,
moss-covered stems. The <i>algae</i> of the ocean bed, with its
lianes and creeping growth, twisted all about the submarine,
fluttering and waving in the currents caused by
the swiftly revolving propeller.</p>

<p>A gasp escaped Matt's lips, however, when he fixed his
attention forward. For a full minute he stood on the
ladder, taking in the weird and dangerous predicament
of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>Then an exclamation fell from his lips, and he looked
down to see Captain Nemo, Jr., slowly mounting to his
side.</p>

<p>"Look!" whispered Matt hoarsely, nodding toward the
lunettes.</p>

<p>The captain pressed his eyes against the thick glass
and then dropped back.</p>

<p>"A ship!" he exclaimed. "We have rammed an old
Spanish galleon and are caught in her rotting timbers!"</p>

<p>He looked upward, his startled eyes engaging Matt's,
and the two staring at each other.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">OUT OF THE JAWS OF DEATH.</p>


<p>What the captain had said was true. The <i>Grampus</i>,
cruising in those great depths, had had the misfortune
to hurl herself bodily on into an ancient wreck.</p>

<p>The wreck, which must have lain for centuries there on
the bottom, was covered with marine growth, yet, nevertheless,
seemed wonderfully well preserved. The high
bow and poop, covered with serpent-like lianes and creeping
weeds, were erect in the water, for the galleon lay
on an even keel. The ship's two masts and steep bowsprit
had been broken off, and the decks were a litter of
weeds, and shells, and sand.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i>, cleaving the heavy submarine growth,
had flung her sharp prow into the galleon's side and
was embedded almost to the flagstaff.</p>

<p>The captain and Matt descended silently into the periscope
room.</p>

<p>"We jammed into an old wreck, did we?" queried
Cassidy, calmly but with a look on his face which reflected
the perturbation of his mind.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Matt. "Some Spanish ship went
down here&mdash;perhaps loaded with treasure for across the
sea."</p>

<p>"Hardly loaded with treasure, Matt," spoke up the
captain. "This is the Spanish Main, and the reefs off
Honduras offered shelter for many a pirate in the old
days. This galleon, I am inclined to think, was stripped
of her treasure by some buccaneer and sunk. It is too
bad that she was sunk in the course we happened to be
taking."</p>

<p>The rack of the useless motor ceased on an order
from Matt; in the deep, death-like silence that intervened,
a wail came up from the tank room.</p>

<p>"Vat's der madder mit us, Matt? Dit ve run indo a
cave in der ocean? Oof ve can't ged oudt vat vill pecome
oof us?"</p>

<p>"We ran into an old Spanish ship, Carl," answered
Matt, "and we are so jammed in the side of the hulk
that we haven't been able, so far, to back out."</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber! Meppy ve von't nefer be aple to
pack oudt! Meppy ve vas down here for keeps, hey?
Nexdt dime I go down in some supmarines, you bed my
life I make a vill pefore I shtart."</p>

<p>Carl, white as a sheet and scared, came rolling into
the periscope room. Dick likewise showed up from
forward.</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky, old ship," said he, "I hadn't any
notion this was to be our last cruise."</p>

<p>"It's not," answered Matt. "We'll get out of this."</p>

<p>He turned to Captain Nemo, Jr., who was again seated
quietly, his calm eyes on the king of the motor boys.</p>

<p>"The power of the screw, unaided," said the captain,
"will not serve to get us clear of the wreck. What are
you going to do, Matt?"</p>

<p>Matt thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Am I to have my way, captain?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I want to see what you can do."</p>

<p>"Speake! Gaines! Clackett!" called Matt. "Come up
here, at once."</p>

<p>From the engine room, the torpedo room, and the
ballast room came the rest of the submarine's crew.
Their faces were gray with anxiety, but they were men
of pluck and determination, and could be depended on
to fight for life until the very last.</p>

<p>"Men," said Matt, "we have rammed an old hulk that
has been lying for centuries in the bottom of St. George's
Bay. The nose of the <i>Grampus</i> is caught and held in the
wreck's side, and the full power of the engine is not
sufficient to pull us out. We shall have to try something
else&mdash;something that will put a great strain on the steel
shell of the submarine, considering the pressure the boat
is under at this enormous depth. I am going to give
some orders, and on the swiftness with which they are
carried out our lives may depend. You will all go back
to your stations, Carl with Clackett and Dick with
Gaines; and when I shout the word 'Ready!' the engine
will be started with all power astern. At the same instant,
Clackett and Carl will open the pipes and admit
air into the ballast tanks, and open the valves that let out
the water. We may have to do all this several times, if
necessary, but you fellows have got to be prompt in
doing what you are told."</p>

<p>Again was admiration reflected in Captain Nemo's
pale face. Leaning back against the steel wall of the
periscope room, he settled himself quietly to await developments.</p>

<p>"Count on me," said Clackett, as he and Carl disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"And on us," said Gaines, leaving the periscope room
with Dick.</p>

<p>Cassidy merely gave a nod and turned to his steering
wheel. Matt went up into the tower and placed himself
at one of the lunettes.</p>

<p>His heart was beating against his ribs with trip-hammer
blows, but his brain was cool and clear.</p>

<p>When he had given the crew sufficient time to gain
their stations, he lifted his voice loudly.</p>

<p>"<i>Ready!</i>"</p>

<p>The word rang through the periscope room and echoed
clatteringly through the steel hull.</p>

<p>The propeller began to whirl like mad, and the sudden
opening of the ballast tanks depressed the free rear portion
of the submarine.</p>

<p>For a full minute the wild struggle went on, and so
shaken was the boat that it seemed as though she must fly
in pieces. Then, abruptly, the <i>Grampus</i> leaped backward
and upward, clearing the forest-like growth of seaweed
at a gigantic bound.</p>

<p>The upward motion was felt by every one in the boat,
and cries of exultation came to Matt's ears in clamoring
echoes.</p>

<p>Slipping like lightning down the ladder, he shouted to
Gaines to stop the madly-working engine and reverse it
at a more leisurely speed.</p>

<p>Like a huge air bubble, the <i>Grampus</i> swung up and
up, and when she emerged above the surface, and Matt
could see sunlight through the dripping lunettes, he
turned off the electric projector, opened the hatch and
threw it back, and gulped down deep breaths of the
warm, fresh air.</p>

<p>Once more slipping down the ladder, he saluted the
captain.</p>

<p>"I turn the ship over to you, sir," said he, and collapsed
on a stool, mopping the perspiration from his face.</p>

<p>"You're a brick!" grunted Cassidy, picking up the
course for Belize.</p>

<p>"Hooray for Motor Matt, king of the motor boys!"
came a thrilling shout from somewhere in the bowels of
the craft.</p>

<p>For an instant, the steel walls echoed with the jubilant
yells of Carl, Dick, Gaines, Speake, and Clackett.</p>

<p>"It came near to taking the ginger all out of me, captain,"
breathed Matt. "The novelty of the thing was
mighty trying."</p>

<p>Captain Nemo, Jr., still strangely pale, was regarding
the youth fixedly. For some moments after the cheering
ceased he said nothing; then, leaning abruptly forward,
he caught Matt's hand.</p>

<p>The captain's flesh was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>"Captain!" the young motorist exclaimed, starting up,
"there's something wrong with you! Do you feel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain waved his hand deprecatingly, and the
calm, inscrutable smile hovered about his thin lips.</p>

<p>"Let that pass for a moment, my lad," said he. "I
was testing the <i>Grampus</i>, but, more than that, I was likewise
testing <i>you</i>. Since we picked up Carl and Dick,
off the <i>Dolphin</i>, and before that, while we were cruising
about trying to find them,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> you have been serving your
apprenticeship on the submarine. I have always had the
utmost confidence in you, Motor Matt, and I have now,
I think, tested your knowledge of the <i>Grampus</i> in a manner
which leaves no room for doubt. You are able to
run the boat, and to extricate her from any difficulties
in which she might become entangled, as well, if not
better, than I could do myself."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This reference of Captain Nemo, Jr., has to do with the
thrilling experiences of Carl and Dick while they were at swords'
points with Captain James Sixty, the filibuster, for an extended
account of which see No. 15 of the <span class="smcap">Motor Stories</span>, "Motor
Matt's Submarine; or, The Strange Cruise of the <i>Grampus</i>."</p></div>

<p>Matt, from the captain's manner, had suspected that
the gray-haired inventor of the craft had tried to bring
out all that was in him. Captain Nemo, Jr., of course,
had not been able to forecast the trouble that was to
overtake the submarine in the bottom of the bay, but this
dangerous experience had served only to show Matt's
resourcefulness to better advantage.</p>

<p>"You are cool-headed in time of danger," proceeded
the captain, "and, no matter what goes wrong, your
ability is always on tap and can be brought to bear instantly
upon anything you desire to accomplish."</p>

<p>The red ran into Matt's face and he waved a hand
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"I'm not a particle better than a lot of other fellows,"
said he, "who try to use their eyes, and hands, and
brains."</p>

<p>"I expected you to say that, Matt," continued the captain.
"The test, in your case, was hardly necessary, for
I have watched your work in a lot of trying situations&mdash;and
it has always been the same, steady, resourceful, reliable.
Just now, we are going to Belize, British Honduras,
to carry out some work for our government. As
I have already told you, I don't know what that work is.
Two sealed envelopes were given me by Captain Wynekoop
of the U. S. cruiser <i>Seminole</i>. The first one told
us to proceed to Belize. The next one, which I have
here in my pocket, will instruct you relative to the work
in prospect, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Instruct <i>me</i>?" broke in Matt, startled.</p>

<p>The captain nodded.</p>

<p>"I have not recovered from the strange illness which
overtook me in New Orleans, as a result of inhaling the
poisonous odor given off by the head of that idol. I
feel that another attack is coming upon me&mdash;I have felt
it for several hours&mdash;and, inasmuch as the government
is watching the work of the <i>Grampus</i> with the intention
of buying her at a good round price if she makes good,
our sealed orders must be carried out. For this work,
Matt, you are my choice; you are to command the
<i>Grampus</i>, do everything that you think&mdash;that you
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Nemo, Jr., paused, struggled with the words
for a space, then drooped slowly forward and fell from
his seat to the floor of the room. There he lay, unconscious
and breathing heavily.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SEALED ORDERS.</p>


<p>For a brief space Motor Matt and Cassidy stood looking
down at the prostrate form crumpled at their feet.
The captain had been stricken so suddenly that they were
astounded.</p>

<p>Cassidy took a look through the periscope and lashed
the wheel; then he hurried to help Matt, who was lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the unconscious man to a long locker at the side of the
room.</p>

<p>"He ain't never been right since he was sick in New
Orleans," muttered Cassidy. "He jumped into work before
he was well enough."</p>

<p>The captain's former illness had been of a peculiar
nature. An idol's head, steeped in some noxious liquor
that caused the head to give off a deadly odor, was,
according to his firm belief, the cause of his sickness.
Carl had also come under the influence of the poisonous
odor, but it had had no such effect upon him. However,
no two persons are exactly alike, and sometimes a thing
that will work havoc with one may have no effect upon
another.</p>

<p>"His heart action is good, Cassidy," said Matt.</p>

<p>"He's a sick man for all that," replied the mate. "I've
noticed for several hours he was nervous like. We'll
have to take him ashore at Belize, and you'll have to be
the captain while we're doing the work that's to be
done."</p>

<p>There was an under-note in Cassidy's voice that
caused Matt to give him a keen look. The mate was a
good fellow, but he was second in command, aboard the
<i>Grampus</i>, and it was quite natural for him to expect to
be the one who stepped into the captain's shoes.</p>

<p>"You heard what Captain Nemo, Jr., said?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure, I did," returned the mate gruffly.</p>

<p>"I had not the least notion he was picking me for any
such place."</p>

<p>"He's a queer chap, the cap'n is," said Cassidy, averting
his face and getting up from the side of the locker.
"I'll go get him a swig of brandy&mdash;maybe it'll bring him
round."</p>

<p>When Cassidy returned from the storeroom with the
brandy flask, Matt could hardly avoid detecting that he
had himself sampled the liquor. Matt was disagreeably
surprised, for he had not known that the mate was a
drinking man.</p>

<p>While they were forcing a little of the brandy down
the captain's throat, Dick and Carl came into the periscope
room.</p>

<p>"Vat's der madder mit der gaptain?" asked Carl, as
he and Dick crowded close to the locker.</p>

<p>Matt told of the illness that had so suddenly overtaken
the master of the submarine.</p>

<p>"Shiver me, but it's main queer!" exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>"For the last hour," went on Matt, "the captain's
hands have been like ice and his face pale. I knew he
didn't feel well, but I hadn't any idea he was as bad as
this."</p>

<p>"Tough luck!" growled Cassidy.</p>

<p>"Will we need a pilot to take us into Belize?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"We can't get very close to the town, but will have to
lay off and go ashore in a boat. I know the place well
enough to take the <i>Grampus</i> to a safe berth."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better go up in the lookout, Cassidy, and
see to laying us alongside the town."</p>

<p>A mutinous look flickered for an instant on Cassidy's
weather-beaten face. He hesitated, and then, without a
word, turned away and climbed into the conning tower.</p>

<p>A moment more and the captain had revived and
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"How are you feeling, sir?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Far from well, my lad," was the answer, in a weak
voice. "Are we off Belize?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir, but we are drawing close."</p>

<p>"We are close enough so that we can read the second
half of our sealed orders."</p>

<p>The captain lifted a hand and removed from the breast
pocket of his coat a sealed envelope, which he handed to
Matt.</p>

<p>"Open it, Matt," said he, "and read it aloud."</p>

<p>The young motorist paused.</p>

<p>"Captain," said he, "wouldn't Cassidy be the right man
for carrying out the work that brought us into these
waters? He is the mate, you know, and I think he
expects&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cassidy is here to obey orders," interrupted the captain.
"Cassidy has a failing, and that failing is drink.
No man that takes his liquor is ever to be depended on.
As long as I'm around, and can watch him, Cassidy
keeps pretty straight, but if I'm laid up at Belize, as I
expect to be, I prefer to have some one in command of
the <i>Grampus</i> whom I can trust implicitly. Read the
orders."</p>

<p>Matt tore open the envelope and removed the inclosed
sheet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Acting under orders from the Secretary of the
Navy, I have the honor to request that the <i>Grampus</i> lend
her aid to the rescue of United States Consul Jeremiah
Coleman, who has been sequestered by Central American
revolutionists, presumably under orders from Captain
James Sixty, of the brig <i>Dolphin</i>, who is now a prisoner
in our hands. Mr. Hays Jordan, the United States consul
at Belize, will inform you as to the place where Mr. Coleman
is being held. This is somewhere up the Rio Dolce,
in a place inaccessible to even gunboats of the lightest
draught, and it is hoped the <i>Grampus</i> may be able to
accomplish something. Present this letter to Mr. Jordan
immediately upon reaching Belize, and be guided in
whatever you do by his knowledge and judgment. I
have the honor to remain, sir,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>A movement behind Matt caused him to look around.
Cassidy had descended quietly from the conning tower
and was steering the ship entirely by the periscope.</p>

<p>"We are off Belize, sir," announced Cassidy, "and two
small sailboats are coming this way. We are to anchor
at the surface, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Matt did not know how long the mate had been in the
periscope room, but supposed he had been there long
enough to overhear the instructions.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the captain.</p>

<p>Cassidy touched a jingler connected with the engine
room. The hum of the motor slowly ceased.</p>

<p>"Get out an anchor fore-and-aft, Speake," the mate
called through one of the speaking tubes.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," came the response through the tube.</p>

<p>A little later a muffled rattling could be heard as a
chain was paid out through the patent water-tight hawse
hole. Presently the rattling stopped, and the <i>Grampus</i>
shivered and swung to her scope of cable. More rattling
came from the stern, and soon two anchors were holding
the submarine steady in her berth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want you to go ashore, Matt," said Captain Nemo,
Jr., "and see the American consul. Find a place where
I can be taken care of; also, show that letter to the
consul and tell him you are my representative. Better
take Dick with you."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied Matt.</p>

<p>A bluish tinge had crept into the pallor of the captain's
face. Matt had been covertly watching, and his
anxiety on the captain's account had increased. The
captain must be taken ashore as quickly as possible and
placed in a doctor's hands.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dick," called Matt, starting up the conning
tower ladder.</p>

<p>With his chum at his heels, Matt crawled over the
rim of the conning tower hatch and lowered himself
to the rounded steel deck.</p>

<p>The port of Belize, nestling in a tropical bower of
cocoanut trees, was about a mile distant. Owing to her
light draught, the <i>Grampus</i> had been able to come closer
to the town than other ships in the harbor. The submarine
lay between a number of sailing vessels and
steamboats and the line of white buildings peeping out
of the greenery beyond the beach.</p>

<p>Two small sailboats, manned by negroes, were approaching
the <i>Grampus</i>. Matt motioned to one of them,
and her skipper hove-to alongside, caught a rope thrown
by Dick, and pulled his craft as near the deck of the
submarine as the rounded bulwarks would permit. A
plank was pushed over the side of the sailboat, and Matt
and Dick climbed over the lifting and shaking board.</p>

<p>"Golly, boss," grinned the negro, "dat's de funniest
boat dat I ever seen in dis port. Looks like er bar'l on
er raft."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," said Matt, "but lay us alongside
the wharf as soon as you can."</p>

<p>The two negroes comprising the sailboat's crew were
Caribs. They talked together in their native tongue,
every word seeming to end in "boo" or "boo-hoo."</p>

<p>"A whoop, two grunts and a little blubbering," said
Dick, "will give a fellow a pretty fair Carib vocabulary.
What ails Cassidy?"</p>

<p>"I think he sampled the flask of brandy when he
brought it to the captain," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"That was plain enough, for he had a breath like a
rum cask. But it wasn't that alone that made him so
grouchy. There's something else at the bottom of his
locker."</p>

<p>"Well, he's the mate," went on Matt, dropping his
voice and turning a cautious look on the two negroes,
"and I suppose he thinks Captain Nemo, Jr., ought to
have put him in command. To have a fellow like me
jumped over his head may have touched him a little."</p>

<p>"Mayhap," murmured Dick, "but it's a brand-new side
of his character Cassidy's showing. I never suspected
it of him. Do you think the captain's trouble is anything
serious?"</p>

<p>"I hope not, Dick, but I'm worried. The sickness
came on so suddenly I hardly know what to think."</p>

<p>"Probably he has some of the poison from that idol's
head still under his hatches. Main queer, though, that
he should be so long getting over it, when Carl cut himself
adrift from the same thing so handsomely."</p>

<p>"Things of that kind never affect two people in exactly
the same way."</p>

<p>The negroes brought their boat alongside the wharf.
As Matt paid for their services, and climbed ashore, Dick
called his attention to the <i>Grampus</i>. Cassidy could be
seen on the speck of deck running the Stars and Stripes
to the top of the short flagstaff. The other sailboat, to
the boy's surprise, was standing in close to the submarine.</p>

<p>Having finished with the flag, Cassidy could be seen
to throw a rope to the skipper of the sailboat, and then,
a moment later, to spring aboard.</p>

<p>"What does that move mean?" queried Dick.</p>

<p>"Give it up," answered Matt, with a mystified frown.
"Probably we shall know, before long. Just now, though,
we've got to think of the captain and send off a doctor
to the <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>Turning away, he and Dick walked rapidly to the
shore and on into the town.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE AMERICAN CONSUL.</p>


<p>"There's a bobby," cried Dick, catching sight of a
policeman, "a real London bobby, blue-and-white striped
cuffs and all. We'll bear down on him, Matt, and ask
the way to the American consul's."</p>

<p>The policeman was dark-skinned, but kind and
obliging for all that. Drawing the boys out into the
street, he pointed to a low, white building with the American
flag flying over the door. There were palms and
trees around the building, and a middle-aged man in
white ducks was sitting in a canvas chair on the veranda.
He was Mr. Hays Jordan, and when the boys told him
they were from the submarine <i>Grampus</i>, the consul got
up and took them by the hand.</p>

<p>Matt lost not a moment in telling of the captain's illness,
and of his desire for a doctor and of comfortable
lodging ashore. The consul seemed disappointed by the
news.</p>

<p>"I reckon that puts a stop to the work that brought the
<i>Grampus</i> here," said the consul.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Matt. "The <i>Grampus</i> is at the
service of the government within an hour, if necessary."</p>

<p>"But who's in charge of the boat?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>Mr. Hays Jordan looked Matt over, up and down,
and started to give an incredulous whistle. But there
was something in the youth's bearing, and in the firm,
gray eye that caused him to quit whistling.</p>

<p>"Well!" he exclaimed. "Pretty young to be skipper
of a submarine, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Belay a bit, sir," spoke up Dick. "He's old for his
age, if I do say it, and Captain Nemo, Jr., is a master
hand at taking the sizing of a fellow. He selected Motor
Matt to engineer this piece of work, and, if you keep
your weather eye skinned, it won't be long until you rise
to the fact that the captain knew what he was about."</p>

<p>"The captain ought to have a doctor without loss of
time," interposed Matt, impatient because of the time they
were losing, "and he must have a place to stay."</p>

<p>"We'll not send a sick man to the hotel," said Mr.
Jordan, "but to a boarding house kept by an American.
And we'll also have an American doctor to look after
him." He slapped his hands. In answer to the summons
a negro appeared from inside the house. "Go over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to Dr. Seymour, Turk," said the consul, "and ask him to
come here."</p>

<p>"We might be able to save time," put in Matt, "if my
friend went with your servant and took the doctor directly
to the submarine."</p>

<p>"Fine!" exclaimed the consul, and Dick and the negro
hurried away.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my boy," said the consul, waving his hand
toward a chair, "and we'll palaver a little. I don't reckon
I ought to say much to you until I talk with Captain
Nemo, Jr., and make sure everything is right and proper.
Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here are my credentials," said Matt, and handed over
the letter which he had recently read aloud in the periscope
room of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>The consul glanced over the letter.</p>

<p>"I'll take you on that showing, Motor Matt," said he
heartily, as he handed the letter back. "If anything is
done for my friend Coleman, it's got to be done with a
rush. The dinky little states all around us are able to
have a revolution whenever some one happens to think
of it. There's one on now, and Captain James Sixty was
to help on the fighting by landing a cargo of guns and
ammunition. Sixty's work, as I reckon you may know,
was nipped in the bud, and the revolutionists are having
a hard time of it. But they're still active, and about two
weeks ago, when Sixty failed to arrive with the war material
and they were afraid he had been captured by the
United States authorities, the hot-headed greasers
planned reprisal. That reprisal was about the most
foolish thing you ever heard of. They spirited away my
friend Coleman; then they sent me a letter saying that
Coleman would be released whenever the United States
Government gave up Sixty&mdash;and, at that time, Sixty
wasn't in the hands of the authorities, at all. He had
just simply failed to show up with the contraband of war,
and the revolutionists imagined he had been bagged. I
communicated with Washington at once, and it was that,
I reckon, that gave the State Department a line on
Sixty."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Coleman in any danger?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"You never can tell what a lot of firebrands will do.
They're bound to hear of Sixty's capture, and of the
confiscation of his lawless cargo. The news will get to
them soon, and when that happens Coleman is likely to
have trouble. If possible, he must be rescued from the
revolutionists ahead of the receipt of this information
about Sixty and the lost guns. It's a tremendously hard
piece of work, and only a submarine boat with an intrepid
crew, to my notion, will stand any show of success.
If a small boat from a United States warship was
to try to go to the rescue, the revolutionists would learn
she was coming and would immediately take to the
jungles of the interior with their captive. See what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Coleman's captors are somewhere on the sea
coast?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. They have a rendezvous on the river
Izaral, which runs into the gulf of Amatique, to the
south of here. The revolutionists have tried to make
people think that they have Coleman somewhere on the
Rio Dolce, but that would put the whole unlawful game
in British territory, and wherever the British flag flies
you'll find lawbreakers mighty careful."</p>

<p>The consul looked around cautiously and then hitched
his chair closer to Matt's.</p>

<p>"I haven't been idle, Motor Matt," he went on, lowering
his voice. "I have had spies at work, and one of
them has reported the exact location of the revolutionists'
camp. Acting as a log-cutter, he came close to the place.
This man will lead you to the exact spot&mdash;and, as good
luck has it, he's a pilot and knows the coast."</p>

<p>"I should think," hazarded Matt, "that the United
States government could make a demand on the president
of the republic where all this lawless work is going on,
and force him to rescue Mr. Coleman."</p>

<p>The consul laughed.</p>

<p>"You don't know Central America, my lad," he answered.
"It's as hard for the president of the republic
to get at the revolutionists as for anybody else. Meanwhile,
Coleman's in danger. We can't wait for a whole
lot of useless red-tape proceedings. We've got to strike,
and to strike hard and quick. But we've got to do it secretly,
quietly&mdash;getting Coleman away before the revolutionists
know what we're doing. Understand?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded.</p>

<p>"We'll not do any fighting if it's possible to avoid it,"
proceeded the consul, "for that would merely complicate
matters. Besides, what could a handful of strangers do
against a horde of rascally niggers? Softly is the word.
We've got to jump into 'em, and then out again quicker
than scat&mdash;and when we come out we've got to have
Coleman."</p>

<p>"Are you going with us, Mr. Jordan?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>The consul started and gave Matt a bored look.</p>

<p>"Going with you?" he drawled. "Why not? It isn't
often we have anything exciting, here in Honduras, and
I wouldn't miss the chance for a farm. Coleman lives
where he never knows what minute is going to be his
next, and he's continually guessing as to where the lightning
is going to strike, and when. About all I do is lie
around in a hammock, fight mosquitoes, take a feed now
and then at Government House, and drop in at an English
club here every evening for a rubber at whist. It's
deadly monotonous, my lad, to a fellow who comes from
the land of snap and ginger."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to have you along," said Matt. "When
had we better start?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon." The consul picked his solar hat off
the railing of the veranda and got up. "I'm going over
to the boarding house," he added, "to make arrangements
for Captain Nemo, Jr. It's just around the corner
and I'll only be gone a few minutes. Make yourself
comfortable until I return."</p>

<p>"I'll get along all right," answered Matt.</p>

<p>Jordan got up, descended the steps, swung away down
the street and quickly vanished around a corner.</p>

<p>The scenery was all new and strange to Matt, and he
allowed his eyes to wander up and down the street. The
houses were white bungalows, some of them surrounded
by high white fences, and with tufted palms nodding over
their roofs.</p>

<p>Negro women passed by with baskets on their heads,
dark-skinned laborers in bell-crowned straw hats
slouched up and down, and a group of tawny soldiers
from a West India regiment, wearing smart Zouave uniforms
and turbans, jogged past.</p>

<p>As soon as Matt had exhausted the sights in his immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
vicinity, he lay back in the chair and gave his
thoughts to the captain.</p>

<p>He had always liked Nemo, Jr. The captain had been
a good friend to Motor Matt and his chums, and the
young motorist hoped in his heart that his present illness
would not take a serious turn.</p>

<p>While Matt was turning the subject over in his mind,
two men came along the walk and started for the steps
leading to the veranda of the consulate.</p>

<p>Matt, suddenly lifting his eyes, was surprised to note
that one of the men was Cassidy. The other was a white,
sandy-whiskered individual in a dingy blue coat and
cap and much-worn dungaree trousers.</p>

<p>Both were plainly under the influence of liquor. They
came unsteadily up the steps and Cassidy made a bee-line
for Matt.</p>

<p>Cassidy's weather-beaten face was flushed and there
was an angry, unreasoning light in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm next to you, Matt King," growled the mate, posting
himself in front of the youth and clinching his big
fists. "You've pulled the wool over the old man's eyes
in great shape, but you can't fool <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Cassidy, when his mind was clear and when he was
not under the delusion of a fancied wrong, was a good
fellow. He had cared for Captain Nemo, Jr., when he
was lying ill in New Orleans, and countless times he had
given Matt and his chums proof of his friendship for
them. Cassidy was off his bearings now, but Matt felt
more like arguing with him than showing authority.</p>

<p>"You are not yourself, Cassidy," said the young motorist.
"Why did you leave the <i>Grampus</i>?"</p>

<p>"That's my business," snarled the mate.</p>

<p>"Well, take my advice and go back there. No one is
trying to deceive the captain."</p>

<p>"You've wormed yourself into his confidence, and what
has he done to me?" There was bitterness in the mate's
voice. "I'm the one that ought to be cap'n of the submarine, and,
by thunder, I'm going to be!"</p>

<p>Matt got up from his chair, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"You're going to obey orders, Cassidy," said he, "if
you want to stay with the <i>Grampus</i>. I'm in command,
and I'll give you just a minute to leave here and make for
the wharf. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment the mate's crazy wrath got the better
of him. With a hoarse oath, he lurched forward and
struck at Matt with his fist.</p>

<p>Matt avoided the blow with a quick side-step.</p>

<p>"Now's yer chance, Cassidy," breathed the husky voice
of the man who had come with the mate. "It's now or
never if you want to put him down an' out."</p>

<p>The fellow, as he spoke, slouched toward Matt with
doubled fists. Matt had not the same consideration for
this stranger that he had for the mate, and immediately
after evading Cassidy's blow he whirled about.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>For answer, the man tried to get in a blow on his own
account. But he was not quick enough. With a nimble
leap forward, Matt swung his own fist straight from the
shoulder. The dingy blue cap flew off and its owner
reeled against the side of the building. Just then Matt
felt the arms of the mate going around him from behind.</p>

<p>At the same moment, however, footsteps came swiftly
along the walk, mounted the steps, and Cassidy was
caught by the throat in a firm grip.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTOR MATT'S FORBEARANCE.</p>


<p>"What's all this? Jupiter! Two webfeet sailing into
one lone-handed youngster! And he seems to be holding
his own pretty well, at that. Let go, you!"</p>

<p>With that, Jordan wrenched Cassidy away and flung
him heavily against one of the veranda posts.</p>

<p>The stranger, scowling and nursing a bruise on his
chin, was gathering up his blue cap. Cassidy, panting
and wheezing, was leaning against the post and glaring
wrathfully at the consul.</p>

<p>"That man," said Matt, pointing toward the mate, "is
Cassidy, second in command aboard the submarine. He
takes it hard because Captain Nemo, Jr., placed me in
charge, and he came ashore without authority. Who
the other fellow is I don't know, but I presume it is some
trouble maker the mate picked up."</p>

<p>"Trouble maker is right," went on Jordan. "That
describes the rascal to a t, y, ty. I know him. He's
Fingal, master of a shady schooner called the <i>North Star</i>,
an all around bad one, and the authorities in a dozen
ports in Central America will tell you the same. We'll
land him in the skookum house. And as for Cassidy, it's
against regulations for an officer to attack one who outranks
him. We'll put <i>him</i> in the cooler, too."</p>

<p>The consul was about to call some one from the house
with the intention of sending for an officer, when Matt
interposed.</p>

<p>"I don't want to do anything like that, Jordan. These
men have been drinking."</p>

<p>"That's no excuse."</p>

<p>"But Cassidy, when he's not half-seas over and got a
fancied grievance, is a good fellow. He has proved that
to me a hundred times. Besides, Captain Nemo, Jr.,
thinks a lot of him."</p>

<p>"Well, he can't think much of the captain," answered
the consul dryly, "or he'd pay more attention to his
orders. What do you want to do with the two men?"</p>

<p>"Let Fingal go about his business, if he has any. As
for Cassidy, he can go back to the submarine and give
his brain a chance to clear. After that he'll see things
differently."</p>

<p>"I know my rights," snapped Cassidy, shuffling around
belligerently, "and I'm going to hold out for 'em. I've
been mate of the <i>Grampus</i> ever since she was launched.
And now that the old man's laid up, I ought to be master.
This here Motor Matt hasn't been on the submarine
more'n two weeks, put together."</p>

<p>"Did you hear Captain Nemo, Jr., say that Motor Matt
was to be put in charge of the craft?" queried Jordan.</p>

<p>"I heard it, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did the rest of the crew hear it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, only they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everybody understands the situation, then?"</p>

<p>"I guess they do, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then this is a case of all cry and no wool. You're
making a fool of yourself, Cassidy, let alone showing
mighty poor taste. Motor Matt is showing a whole lot
more forbearance than I'd ever do, in the same circumstances.
You made an attack on your commanding
officer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't admit he's that," broke in Cassidy fiercely.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man!" cried the consul, out of patience.
"You'd admit it quick enough if you wasn't drunk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"What business you got buttin' into this, anyway?"</p>

<p>Jordan pointed to the flag.</p>

<p>"This is a patch of American soil right in the middle
of a foreign country," said he. "That flag is yours and
mine, and I'm here to adjust just such differences as this
between my fellow-countrymen. Motor Matt is captain
of the <i>Grampus</i>, and you've heard his orders. If you
and Fingal don't clear out, I'll call a policeman and have
the pair of you taken to the lock-up."</p>

<p>Fingal edged away toward the veranda steps. As he
drew close to Cassidy, he muttered something. The mate
gave a thick response, and the two lurched down the
steps and out of sight along the walk.</p>

<p>"Fingal," said Jordan, after watching the two out of
sight, "is setting the mate up to act as he's doing. His
influence is bad, particularly as the mate appears to be a
good deal of a numskull without much reasoning ability
of his own."</p>

<p>"He has always been a first-rate hand," returned Matt
regretfully, "up in his duties and entirely reliable. This
sudden move of his is one of the biggest surprises I ever
had sprung on me."</p>

<p>"That's the way with some people. Give 'em the idea
that they've been imposed on, and they're just weak
enough in the head to make all sorts of trouble. If you've
got the rest of the crew with you, though, it will be easy
enough to take care of Cassidy. However, if he wanted
to he could make lots of trouble for this expedition."</p>

<p>"I'll see that he doesn't do that. If he shows a disposition
along that line, I'll have him locked in the torpedo
room. Why he ever came here and set upon me like he
did, is a mystery. I guess it was because he was too
drunk to know what he was doing."</p>

<p>"That's an easy way to explain it," was the consul's
sarcastic comment. "On the other hand, he may have
come here with the expectation of doing something to
you that would make it necessary for you to be left in
Belize with Captain Nemo, Jr."</p>

<p>"No," answered Matt firmly, "I can't believe that."</p>

<p>"You're altogether too easy," proceeded the consul.
"If you were hung up here with a couple of fractured
ribs, or a broken arm, Cassidy would be the only one left
to command the <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"Cassidy isn't a brute," said he. "I'd like to know,
though, why this chap, Fingal, is putting in his oar."</p>

<p>"He's got an axe to grind. Drunk or sober, Abner
Fingal always has his eye on the main chance."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He's a Yank, from somewhere up in Maine, but he's
been in these waters so long he's about half Spanish.
Crooked as a dog's hind leg&mdash;that's Fingal for you.
Sometimes he hoists the flag of Costa Rica, sometimes
that of Nicaragua, and now and then the cross of St.
George, but no matter what colors he sails under he's
the same old sixpence. Too bad Cassidy fell in with
him. But there's no use of our wasting any time on
those fellows. We've got the job of our lives ahead of us,
and we've got to get the work started. Any arms aboard
the <i>Grampus</i>?"</p>

<p>"I thought you said there wasn't to be any fighting?"</p>

<p>"I hope there won't be, my lad, and we'll do everything
possible to avoid it, but there's always a chance
of being slipped up in our calculations. How's the submarine
armed?"</p>

<p>"There's a Whitehead torpedo in the torpedo room."</p>

<p>"We'll not use any torpedoes. If there's a scrap, it
will be on the land and hand to hand. Any rifles or ammunition
aboard?"</p>

<p>"None that I know about."</p>

<p>"Then I'll bring a few guns, merely to be on the safe
side. You'll attend to the other equipment?"</p>

<p>"About all we'll need is a barrel of gasoline. I can
pick that up and have it taken off to the boat."</p>

<p>"I'll come aboard, bringing this pilot I was telling you
about, and the rest of the plunder, along toward evening.
We'll drop down the coast to-night and start for the
rendezvous of the revolutionists in the morning. It will
be well, I think, to go up the river with the <i>Grampus</i>
submerged. In that manner we shall be able to hide our
approach. However, that is something we can settle
later. If you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The consul paused, his eyes down the street.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "here comes your friend, Ferral,
and he appears to be in a tearing hurry. I wonder if
anything has gone wrong with Nemo, Jr.?"</p>

<p>This thought was uppermost in Matt's mind as he
sprang to the top of the steps and watched Dick running
toward the consulate along the street.</p>

<p>"What's up, Dick?" he asked anxiously, as his chum
came close. "Is the captain all right?"</p>

<p>"They're bringing him on a stretcher, and the doctor
thinks he'll be all right in a few days," Dick answered.
"It wasn't that that made me clap on all sail, matey, but
something else."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Why, Cassidy. As we were coming ashore with the
captain I saw the mate pulling off to a schooner that was
anchored half a mile t'other side the <i>Grampus</i>. There
was a chunk of a man with him in a blue cap and coat.
They were aboard the schooner when we hit the landing,
and before we started for town, the schooner's anchor
was tripped and she was off down the coast with every
rag of sail hoisted and drawing. What does that mean?
What's Cassidy up to?"</p>

<p>Matt was astounded. Turning blankly on Jordan, he
saw that his face was clouded and ominous.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"ON THE JUMP."</p>


<p>"You say the schooner got away to the south, Ferral?"
asked Jordan.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, and looked as though she was bound for
down the coast. Looks like Cassidy had deserted, Matt."</p>

<p>"We ought to have jailed him," commented Jordan.
"Did Cassidy know anything about the sealed orders,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"Captain Nemo, Jr., had me read the orders aloud in
the periscope room," Matt answered. "Cassidy had been
in the conning tower, but when I finished with the letter
I saw that he was in the room with us."</p>

<p>Jordan's face grew even more foreboding.</p>

<p>"This looks bad!" he exclaimed. "I wouldn't trust
that Fingal man around the corner, and here he's run off
with Cassidy and headed down the coast. There's something
in the wind, and if our game is tipped off before
we get to where we're going it will be a case of up-sticks
with Coleman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think Cassidy would dare tip off our work
to Fingal!" exclaimed Matt, somewhat dashed by the
course of events.</p>

<p>"A drunken man is liable to do anything."</p>

<p>"But what would Cassidy have to gain by telling
Fingal our business to the southward?"</p>

<p>"Why, as for that, Fingal has been suspected of helping
those same revolutionists. If he can help the scoundrels
hang onto Coleman, they might make it worth his
while."</p>

<p>"The letter I read in the periscope room," said Matt,
after a moment's thought, "spoke of the Rio Dolce as the
place where Coleman was being held. This, you tell me,
is wrong. In that event, and assuming that Cassidy
heard the whole of the letter, then he has a clue that's not
to be depended on."</p>

<p>"Fingal must know the Rio Dolce is not the place.
The fact that the schooner bore away to the south proves
that some one has correct information. No, Matt, Fingal
has learned through Cassidy just why the <i>Grampus</i> put
in at Belize; and Cassidy, intoxicated as he is and worked
up over a fancied grievance, has cast in his lot with the
schooner. The pair of them are off to the south to make
trouble for us, take my word for it. What we must do
is to get away as close on their heels as possible. We
can't wait until evening, but must proceed on the jump
and get away without losing any more time than necessary."</p>

<p>"Avast a minute," spoke up Dick. "You remember,
Matt, that there was a schooner took Captain Sixty off
the fruiter <i>Santa Maria</i>, and sailed with him to find the
derelict brig. That schooner was to take off the arms
and ammunition from the wreck, and would have done
so if the submarine hadn't shown up and been backed by
the cruiser <i>Seminole</i>."</p>

<p>"I remember that," said Matt. "What of it, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Well, matey, I'm a Fiji if I don't think the schooner
that took Cassidy and the other swab south is the same
one that figured in our affairs a few days ago."</p>

<p>To all appearances the consul had had news relative
to these events in the gulf. As soon as Dick had finished,
he slapped his hands excitedly.</p>

<p>"Jupiter!" he exclaimed. "This is more proof that
Fingal is hand-and-glove with the revolutionists. This
new move, Matt, means that that pair of scamps are off
for the south to put a spoke in our wheel. We can't delay
the start an instant longer than we find necessary to
finish our preparations."</p>

<p>Before Matt could answer, an open carriage drove
along the street. The doctor was in the rear seat supporting
the captain. The latter looked like a very sick
man indeed, and was leaning feebly against the doctor's
arm.</p>

<p>"Don't tell him anything about Cassidy's running
away," cautioned Matt, starting down the steps and
toward the road. "It would only worry him, and we'll
carry out the work that has been given to us, in spite
of Cassidy and Fingal."</p>

<p>"He knows about it already," said Dick. "We discovered
Cassidy and the other chap making for the schooner
while we were coming ashore."</p>

<p>"Did the captain give Cassidy permission to leave the
submarine?"</p>

<p>"No. Carl said that the captain became unconscious
just when the mate started up to hoist the flag, and that
the mate took another pull at the flask and went on up
the conning tower ladder. It was French leave he took,
nothing less. As soon as Dr. Armstrong got to the
<i>Grampus</i> he wasn't any time at all in bringing the captain
to his senses, and the first man Nemo, Jr., asked
about was Cassidy."</p>

<p>By that time the carriage, which was proceeding
slowly, was opposite Matt, Dick, and Jordan, who formed
a little group on the sidewalk. In response to a gesture
from the captain, the vehicle came to a halt.</p>

<p>"You are the American consul?" asked the captain,
making an effort to straighten up.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jordan.</p>

<p>"I am Captain Nemo, Jr., of the submarine <i>Grampus</i>.
My unfortunate illness puts me out of the work that lies
ahead of the boat and her crew, but Motor Matt, there,
is perfectly capable of discharging the duties of master.
I should feel quite sure of the outcome if it was not for
the mate. He has deserted, and I am positive he intends
to make trouble. You must get away as soon as possible,
Matt. Cassidy went the other way from the Rio Dolce&mdash;which
is a move I can't understand, if he is planning to
interfere with the rescue of Coleman."</p>

<p>Matt and Jordan exchanged quick looks. The captain,
having no information to the contrary, was still under
the impression conveyed by the sealed orders, viz.: that
the captured consul was on the Rio Dolce instead of the
river Izaral. Neither Matt nor Jordan attempted to set
the captain straight.</p>

<p>Evidently the captain had talked more than was good
for him, for when he finished he collapsed, and had hardly
strength enough to say good-by. As he was driven off,
Matt gazed after him sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Strange that a few hours should make such a difference
in Captain Nemo, Jr.," he murmured.</p>

<p>"The climatic change perhaps had something to do
with it, Matt," suggested Jordan. "But we can't stand
around here, my lad. We've got to hustle&mdash;and this
isn't a very good climate to hustle in, either. It's the
land of take-it-easy. You get the submarine in shape,
and I'll hunt up the pilot, get together the war plunder
and my own traps, and join you just as quick as the
nation will let me. On the jump, my lad, on the jump."</p>

<p>Jordan, suddenly energetic, turned and hastened back
into the consulate.</p>

<p>"There's a whole lot to that land lubber, matey," remarked
Dick. "He's as full of snap and get-there as any
chap I ever saw. But what's the first move? You're
the skipper, now, and it's up to you to lay the course."</p>

<p>"We've plenty of stores aboard for the trip we're to
make, with the exception of gasoline. The <i>Grampus</i> will
be in strange waters on a secret mission, and we must
make sure of an abundant supply of fuel at the start-off."</p>

<p>The boys were not long in finding a place where they
could secure the gasoline, and but little longer in getting
a negro carter to convey the barrel to the landing. Here
the same colored boatman who had brought Matt and
Dick ashore was waiting, and the barrel was loaded and
carried out to the submarine.</p>

<p>The sailboat hove-to as close alongside the <i>Grampus</i>
as she could get, and both vessels were made fast to
each other by ropes. The gasoline barrel was tapped, a
hose run out from the conning tower hatch, and the negroes
laid hold of a pump and emptied the barrel into the
gasoline reservoir of the submarine.</p>

<p>Dick took charge of the transfer of the gasoline, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Matt went down into the periscope room and called up
Speake, Clackett, and Gaines.</p>

<p>"Friends," said the king of the motor boys, "we're
off on a short cruise in strange waters&mdash;a cruise that
will probably call for courage, and will certainly require
tact and caution. Mr. Hays Jordan, the American consul,
is going with us, and when he comes aboard he will bring
a pilot who knows where we are to go and will take us
there. You men know that it is Captain Nemo, Jr.'s
order that I take charge of the work ahead of us. Have
you any objection to that?"</p>

<p>"The captain knew his business," averred Gaines
heartily, "and whatever is good enough for him is good
enough for us."</p>

<p>Speake and Clackett likewise expressed themselves in
the same whole-souled manner.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lads," said Matt. "I suppose you
have heard how the mate went off in a huff. That makes
us short-handed, in a way, although the pilot we're to
take on will help out. Our work is government work,
something for Old Glory, and I feel that we will all of
us do our best. We shall have to run all night, and I
will arrange to have Ferral relieve Gaines, and Carl relieve
Clackett. As for Speake, he will have abundant
opportunity to rest, as most of our night work will be on
the surface. Speake may now get us something to eat,
and after that you will all go to your stations."</p>

<p>Speake was not long in getting his electric stove to
work. There were only a few provisions he could prepare
without causing an offensive odor, and the limited
menu was quickly on the table. Hardly was the meal
finished when a boat hove alongside with Jordan. Matt,
Dick, and Carl went up on deck to assist the consul in
getting his traps aboard.</p>

<p>Jordan had exchanged his white ducks for a trim
suit of khaki. Two belts were around his waist, one of
them fluted with cartridges, and the other supporting a
brace of serviceable revolvers. With him came three
Mauser rifles and a box of ammunition.</p>

<p>The pilot was an unkempt half-blood named Tirzal.
He was bareheaded and barefooted, and had a ferret-like
face and shifty, bead-like eyes.</p>

<p>As soon as the impedimenta was stowed below decks,
Matt instructed Tirzal in the steering of the submarine.
The boat could be maneuvred either from the conning
tower or from the periscope room. When maneuvred
from the conning tower, the pilot stood on the iron ladder,
using his eyes over the top of the tower hatch; when
steered from below, compass and periscope were used.</p>

<p>Tirzal grasped the details with surprising quickness,
his little eyes snapping with wonder as they saw the
panorama of ocean, shore and shipping on the mirror top
of the periscope table.</p>

<p>While these instructions were going forward, Gaines
and Dick had gone into the motor room, Clackett and
Carl had posted themselves in the place from which the
submerging tanks were operated, and Speake had gone
forward into the torpedo room.</p>

<p>"We're all ready," said Matt. "Take to the conning
tower, Tirzal, and give your signals."</p>

<p>The half-breed, as proud as a peacock to have the management
of this strange craft under his hands, got up
the ladder until only his bare feet and legs from the
knees down were visible.</p>

<p>Matt, posting himself by the periscope, divided his attention
between the panorama unfolded there and the
work of Tirzal. He was considerably relieved by the
handy manner in which the half-breed took hold of his
work.</p>

<p>With ballast tanks empty, and the <i>Grampus</i> riding as
high in the water as she could, the motor got to work
the instant the anchors were off the bottom and stowed.</p>

<p>"We're off, Jordan!" cried Matt.</p>

<p>"Off on one of the strangest cruises I ever took part
in," returned the consul, his face glowing with the
novelty of the situation; "and it's a cruise, my boy," he
added, a little more soberly, "which is going to demand
all our resourcefulness in the matter of tact, skill, and
courage. Even then there's a chance that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jordan did not finish, but gave Matt a look which expressed
plainly all that he had left unsaid.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LANDING PARTY.</p>


<p>During that night run down the coast the <i>Grampus</i>
was driven at full speed. The electric projector was
fitted against the lunettes of the conning tower, and threw
an eye of light far out over the dark water.</p>

<p>It was the hope of those aboard the submarine that
they would be able to overhaul and pass the schooner,
<i>North Star</i>, which, presumably, was rushing on ahead
of them to interfere in some manner with the work cut
out for the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>The schooner had about three hours' start of the submarine,
but the latter craft was keeping to the surface
and traveling at such a speed that it was thought she
would surely overtake the other boat before the mouth
of the Izaral was reached.</p>

<p>However, in this Matt and Jordan were disappointed.
They passed one steamer, creeping up the coast, but not
another craft did they see.</p>

<p>"The <i>North Star</i> won't be able to ascend the Izaral,
anyhow," commented Jordan. "If Fingal communicates
with the revolutionists, he will have to send a small
boat&mdash;and perhaps we can overhaul that boat before it
reaches the headquarters of the insurgent force."</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of sleep for everybody
aboard the <i>Grampus</i>, that night, but Motor Matt, Dick
and Carl slept the first half of the night, and, after that,
relieved Gaines and Clackett; Speake caught cat naps
off and on; Jordan stretched himself out on top of the
locker in the periscope room and took his forty winks
with nothing to bother him; and Tirzal, when the submarine
was in a fairly clear stretch of her course, was
relieved by Matt and sent down to curl up on the floor
and snore to his heart's content.</p>

<p>The tireless motor hummed the song familiar in Matt's
ears, and the excitement of the work in prospect kept
him keyed to highest pitch in spite of his loss of rest.</p>

<p>In the gray of early morning, an hour after Matt had
turned off the electric projector, he sighted the mouth of
a river with high, bluffy banks on each side. On one
of the banks, peeping out from a covert of royal palms,
was a small village. Directly across the stream from the
village, commanding both the river and the small harbor
in front of the town, was a rude fort.</p>

<p>Matt called Tirzal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's de ruvver, all right, you bet," declared Tirzal,
after taking a look at the periscope. "Stop um boat,
boss," he added. "We no want de people in de town to
see um."</p>

<p>Matt halted the submarine with the touch of a push
button.</p>

<p>"We'd better submerge, Matt," called Jordan. "That's
the way we've got to get up the river, and it's our proper
course for dodging around the town. Can you see anything
of the schooner?"</p>

<p>"There are only a few small native boats in the harbor,"
answered Matt. "The schooner isn't in sight."</p>

<p>"Beats the deuce what's become of the boat," growled
the consul. "If she sent a launch up the river, the
schooner ought to be somewhere around waiting for the
launch to get back."</p>

<p>"She may have pulled off down the coast just to keep
clear of us. How's the water in the river?"</p>

<p>"Him planty deep to where we go, boss," spoke up
Tirzal. "Sometime him t'irty feet, mos'ly fifty feet.
Eberyt'ing go fine if we keep in de channel."</p>

<p>"We'll be on the safe side," went on Matt, "and just
swing along with the water over our decks and the top
of the conning tower. Ten foot submergence, Clackett,"
he added through a speaking tube connecting with the
tank room.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," came back the voice of Clackett.</p>

<p>The hiss of escaping air as the water came into the
tanks was heard, and Matt secured the hatch and came
down the ladder.</p>

<p>The hissing ceased suddenly.</p>

<p>"We're ten feet down, Matt," reported Clackett
through the tube.</p>

<p>"Take the wheel, Tirzal," said Matt.</p>

<p>With head under the periscope hood and one hand
on the wheel, Tirzal rang for slow speed ahead. Matt
and Jordan likewise gave their attention to the periscope
mirror and watched, with curious wonder, while the
tropical river unfolded beneath their eyes like a moving
picture.</p>

<p>The Izaral was bank-full. As the <i>Grampus</i> rounded the
northern bluff and swerved into the river channel, the
high, steep banks, covered with dense foliage, resembled
a narrow lane with a blank wall at its farther end. When
the boat pushed into the stream, however, and fought the
current for three or four hundred yards, the seemingly
blank wall gave place to an abrupt turn.</p>

<p>The submarine took the turn and entered upon another
stretch of the lane.</p>

<p>This part of the river was as perfect a solitude as
though removed thousands of miles from human habitations.
At a distance of perhaps two miles from the coast
the high banks dwindled to low rises, and on each side
was an unbroken forest; the banks were overflowed; the
trees seemed to grow out of the water, their branches
spreading across so as almost to shut out the light of the
sun and were reflected in the water as in a mirror.</p>

<p>Birds of gaudy plumage fluttered among the trees, and
here and there in a bayou alligators could be seen stretching
their torpid bodies in the black ooze.</p>

<p>Tirzal kept his eyes glued to the periscope. The channel
was crooked and dangerous, and a moment's neglect
might hurl the submarine into a muddy bank, causing
trouble and delay, if not actual peril.</p>

<p>For two or three miles farther Tirzal kept the river
channel. Finally they came close to a spot where a deep,
narrow stream entered the Izaral on the right. Tirzal
turned into this branch and, after ascending it for some
fifty yards, had the propeller slowed until it just counteracted
the current and held the <i>Grampus</i> stationary.</p>

<p>"We got to de place, boss," said Tirzal, lifting himself
erect with a deep breath of relief. "Now we come to
de top an' tie de boat to a couple ob trees on de sho'."</p>

<p>"Where are the revolutionists?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Dey a good ways off, boss. We hab to take to de
bank an' go find um. I know de way. Here's where de
boats come. You see um pitpan close by de bank? Him
rebel's boat."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," queried Matt, turning to the consul,
"that the schooner sent word to the rebels by means of
the pitpan?"</p>

<p>Jordan shook his head perplexedly.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't do that. The pitpan is no more than
a mahogany log, hollowed out, and would be a poor
sort of craft to row against the current of the Izaral
while it's at the flood. I can't understand why we don't
see or hear something connected with the schooner. Perhaps,"
and the consul's face brightened, "Fingal and
Cassidy are on the wrong track, after all."</p>

<p>"You go to de top, boss," put in Tirzal, "an' me swim
asho' wid rope; den we warp um boat close to de bank."</p>

<p>As a preparation for his swim, the half-breed began to
divest himself of his clothes.</p>

<p>Matt gave the order to empty the ballast tanks by compressed
air, and the <i>Grampus</i> arose to the surface to the
tune of water splashing from the tanks.</p>

<p>"A party will have to land for the purpose of reconnoitring
the position of the rebels," said Jordan. "I would
suggest, Matt, that the landing party consist of myself,
Tirzal, of course, and some other person who you think
can be easily spared. A strong force will have to remain
with the <i>Grampus</i>, for our situation is encompassed with
dangers. Before we can plan our dash successfully, we
shall have to know something of the lay of the land and
the disposition of the force that is guarding Coleman."</p>

<p>"You are right," returned Matt. "I ought to remain
with the submarine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And get a little sleep," cut in the consul. "You've
been on duty all night and must rest up so as to be ready
for the sharp work when it comes."</p>

<p>"I'll have Speake go with you and Tirzal," said Matt.
"How long will you be gone, Jordan?"</p>

<p>"Not more than two or three hours at the outside."</p>

<p>By then the <i>Grampus</i> was at the surface, and Matt
climbed the ladder and threw back the hatch. Gaining
the dripping iron deck, he looked and listened. The
thick forest lay on every side, and the silence was broken
only by the flapping of wings, and the lazy splash of
alligators in a near-by bayou.</p>

<p>Tirzal, a rope around his waist, scrambled clear of the
conning tower and slipped from the deck into the water.
He swam swiftly and silently to the bank, pulled himself
up, untied the end of the rope from about his waist and
passed it around a tree.</p>

<p>Dick gained the deck, made the boat end of the rope
fast to an iron ring in the bow, and watched while Tirzal
lay back on the cable with all his strength and hauled
the bow shoreward, a foot at a time.</p>

<p>"The bank lays steep-to, matey," announced Dick, "and
we can run the nose of the old flugee right into solid
ground."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will make it easier for Jordan and Speake to
effect a landing," said Matt.</p>

<p>A few minutes of pulling on Tirzal's part brought the
point of the submarine's bow against the bank. Speake
had come up on deck with one of the rifles. A moment
later Jordan followed him, with Carl trailing along in
his wake.</p>

<p>Jordan carried two rifles, one for himself and one for
Tirzal, and also Tirzal's bundle of clothes.</p>

<p>"We're taking all the rifles, Matt," said Jordan, "but
I have left my cartridge belt and six-shooters in the periscope
room. If you should be attacked&mdash;which I hardly
expect&mdash;your best defense will be to sink to the bottom
of the river. We'll be back in three hours. If we're not,
you'll know something has gone wrong with us. But
don't fret about that. Tirzal knows the country, and
he'll steer us clear of trouble."</p>

<p>Speake and Jordan made their way to the point of the
bow and sprang ashore. As soon as Tirzal had slipped
into his clothes and grasped the rifle, the three comprising
the landing party waved their hands to those on the deck
of the boat and vanished into the forest.</p>

<p>"Dose fellers vas going to haf all der fun," grumbled
Carl.</p>

<p>"I don't think anybody is going to have a monopoly
of the 'fun,' as you call it, Carl," said Matt grimly. "You
and Dick stay on deck and keep a sharp watch for rebels.
I'm going to the periscope room to take a nap. In order
to be on the safe side, Dick, you'd better let the <i>Grampus</i>
slide back toward the middle of the stream. Leave the
cable on the tree and pay it off from the bow of the
boat."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, matey," answered Dick.</p>

<p>"Call me if anything happens," said Matt, climbing
into the conning tower.</p>

<p>On reaching the periscope room, he signaled Gaines to
stop the motor, and told him and Clackett that the submarine
was moored, and that they could either sleep or go
on deck, as they preferred.</p>

<p>Matt, thoroughly tired out by his long night vigil,
stretched himself on the locker and was soon sound
asleep.</p>

<p>How long he slept he did not know, but he was suddenly
aroused by a pounding of feet on the steel deck,
startled cries and a tremendous splashing of water.</p>

<p>Thinking that Dick and Carl, who had comprised the
anchor watch, had been caught napping, and that the
revolutionists were making an attack on the boat, he
leaped up, caught the first weapon he could lay hold of,
and darted for the iron ladder.</p>

<p>The weapon happened to be an old harpoon belonging
to Speake, who had once had a berth aboard a whaling
ship.</p>

<p>When Matt lifted his head above the rim of the conning
tower hatch, a strange scene met his eyes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CARL IN TROUBLE.</p>


<p>The most prominent object that met Motor Matt's
startled eyes was a big bull alligator. The creature was
thrashing about in the water, now striking the sides of
the <i>Grampus</i> with its powerful tail, and now making an
attack on the pitpan, or dugout canoe, which has already
been referred to.</p>

<p>Carl Pretzel was in the canoe, and he was wildly
anxious to get back to the submarine. The alligator,
however, was floundering around in the stretch of water
between Carl and the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>"Helup!" whooped Carl. "Der olt man-eader vill ged
me oof you don'd do somet'ing."</p>

<p>It hadn't seemed to occur to the Dutch boy that he
could go ashore&mdash;being much nearer the bank, in fact,
than the submarine.</p>

<p>Dick had a hatchet which he had picked up from somewhere
on the deck. He rushed back to the conning tower
and climbed into it, thus securing an elevated position
which offered some advantage in case he hurled the
hatchet at the big saurian.</p>

<p>"Paddle ashore, Carl!" called Matt.</p>

<p>"Dot's so," gasped Carl; "meppy I vill. Coax der pig
feller avay; I don'd like how he uses dot tail oof his."</p>

<p>Carl fell to work with his paddle. By that time, however,
the alligator's temper was aroused, and, before
Carl had got the pitpan turned, the big creature glided
forward, opened its ponderous jaws and closed them
about the forward end of the dugout.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> The common supposition that an alligator uses only his tail
as a weapon of offense and defense is erroneous. His tail is for
swimming purposes, and his big jaws are his main reliance in
combat.</p></div>

<p>There was a frightful crash, and the sides of the pitpan
were stove in like an eggshell. One end of the wrecked
boat was pushed high in the water, and Carl, at the other
end, was in sore straits.</p>

<p>"Helup, or I vas a goner!" yelled Carl, leaping into
the water as Motor Matt made ready to hurl the harpoon.</p>

<p>Carl's predicament had become serious in the extreme.
If the enraged reptile turned on him, his doom was
sealed. The task for Matt and Dick, which they recognized
on the instant, was to wound the alligator and take
its attention from the boy in the water.</p>

<p>The harpoon left Matt's hand, and the hatchet left
Dick's, at the same moment. The hatchet was turned by
the reptile's scaly coat as by so much armor plate. The
harpoon, however, by a chance, struck just back of the
alligator's fore-leg in the place where the hide was not
so thick. The big fellow had lifted head and shoulders
out of the water in the fierceness of the attack on the
pitpan&mdash;which fact alone made Matt's blow possible.</p>

<p>Dick, tumbling out of the conning tower, seized one
end of a coil of rope and hurled it toward Carl. The
Dutch boy grabbed it, and Dick drew him in rapidly,
hand over hand.</p>

<p>The alligator, meantime, had whipped away around
the bow of the <i>Grampus</i>, half its head only on the surface,
and leaving a reddened trail in its wake.</p>

<p>Carl, sputtering and gasping, fell dripping on the
submarine's deck.</p>

<p>"Be jeerful, be jeerful," he mumbled. "I tell you
somet'ing, dot vas der glosest call vat efer I hat mit meinseluf.
Dot's righdt."</p>

<p>He pulled himself up by means of the periscope mast,
and shook his fist after the alligator, which was returning
to the bayou.</p>

<p>"You don'd make some meals off me, I bed you!" he
taunted. "Nexdt dime you do a t'ing like dot, meppy I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
vill haf a rifle hanty. Den, py shinks, I gif you more as
you can dake care oof."</p>

<p>"You'll have to pay Speake for that harpoon, Carl,"
laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"Mit bleasure," answered Carl. "Id vas der harboon
vat safed my life."</p>

<p>"How did you come to get in that fix?"</p>

<p>"Veil, I t'ink I vould like to look at dot bitban, so Tick
he bulls on der rope und prings der supmarine glose inshore.
I shdep off der pow, valk along der pank und
ged indo der tugoudt; den I bick oop der baddle und
t'ink I vill row pack, as Tick hat let der supmarine oudt

alligador pobs oop righdt py der poat. I say 'shoo' aber

iss vat you know. Ach, blitzen! Der bitban iss gone
oop, und I vas poody near gone oop meinseluf. Anyhow,
a miss iss as goot as a mile, don'd it?"</p>

<p>"It's just as well, I guess," said Matt, "that the dugout
has been destroyed. If we were attacked here by the
rebels, the boat would have helped them. But you should
not have left the submarine, Carl. The noise we have
made here may have been heard. In that event, we can
expect trouble."</p>

<p>Just at that moment, Clackett and Gaines came up
through the hatch.</p>

<p>"What's been going on?" Clackett asked.</p>

<p>"You've missed the fun, matey," returned Dick. "Carl
had a little trouble with an alligator, and just got out of
it by the skin of his teeth."</p>

<p>"Clackett an' me was asleep," said Gaines. "Blamed
funny, though, we didn't hear the rumpus. What woke
me was you fellows, talking and walking over the deck.
Haven't Speake and Jordan shown up yet?"</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"It was a little after twelve when Clackett an' me left
the torpedo room."</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" exclaimed Matt, startled. "I
must have slept longer than I supposed. It was nine
o'clock when Jordan and the others went ashore. Jordan
said they'd be back in three hours, at the outside. More
than three hours have passed and they're not back."</p>

<p>Matt's eyes, suddenly filled with anxiety, swept the
tree-covered bank.</p>

<p>"Tirzal knew the country, mate," said Dick, "and I
guess those fellows are wise enough to steer clear of the
rebels while they're trying to locate Coleman."</p>

<p>"Something may have gone wrong with them, for all
that. If Cassidy and Fingal managed to get word to the
revolutionists, then quite likely Jordan, Speake, and
Tirzal got into a snare. If they did, and if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt was interrupted by the distant report of a rifle,
echoing and re-echoing through the dense timber. There
was just one report, and then silence fell again; but, during
the silence, the troubled glances of those on the
<i>Grampus</i> met questioningly.</p>

<p>"Our landing party has been discovered," declared
Matt, who was first to collect his wits. "Dick and I will
go ashore and see if we can be of any help. I'll leave
you in charge of the <i>Grampus</i>, Gaines. As soon as we
are off the boat, you, and Clackett, and Carl cast off
from the shore, go below and sink until the periscope
ball is just awash. You may have to put out an anchor
to hold the boat against the current. One of you keep
constantly at the periscope, watching the left-hand bank.
If you see one of us come there and wave his arms, you'll
know we want you to come up and take us aboard. Be
as quick as you can, too, for we may be in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Depend on me, Matt," said Gaines.</p>

<p>"Depend on all of us," added Clackett.</p>

<p>Matt turned to his sailor chum.</p>

<p>"Go into the periscope room, Dick," said he, "and get
those two revolvers of Jordan's. Never mind the belts.
Empty out some of the cartridges and put them in your
pocket. Hustle, old chap."</p>

<p>Dick was only gone a few minutes. During that time
Gaines and Clackett were busy with the rope, hauling the
submarine back to the bank, and Matt was listening for
more firing.</p>

<p>No more reports came from the timber, however, and
when Dick reappeared and handed Matt one of the revolvers,
both hurried to the bow of the submarine and
sprang ashore.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your orders, Gaines," cautioned Matt.</p>

<p>"You can bank on it that I won't, Matt," answered the
motorist. "You and Dick look out for yourselves. Don't
make a bad matter worse by letting the revolutionists get
a grip on you. If they did, we'd be in hard shape for
sure."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A FRIEND IN NEED.</p>


<p>At the point where Jordan, Speake and Tirzal had vanished
into the wood, Matt and Dick found a faint path&mdash;a
path so little traveled and so blind that it could not
be seen from the deck of the <i>Grampus</i>, even when she was
hauled close to the shore.</p>

<p>"It's as plain as a hand spike," remarked Dick, as he
and Matt made their way along the path, "that Jordan
and the others took a slant in this direction."</p>

<p>"That's the kind of a guess I'd make," said Matt. "By
following the path, though, we don't want to forget that
they got into trouble. When you're on a road that leads
to trouble, Dick, you've either got to leave it or else
be mighty careful."</p>

<p>"I don't know how we'd get through this jungle if we
didn't follow the path. Tirzal claims to know the country.
If that's a fact, then it's main queer he couldn't
pilot Jordan and Speake around any stray groups of insurrectos."</p>

<p>"Our failure to see anything of the schooner while we
were off the coast, or anything of a launch from the
schooner while we were coming up the river, rather gave
Jordan the idea that Fingal and Cassidy were on the
wrong track. But I'm inclined to think Jordan was wide
of his trail. They must have sent word here and enabled
the revolutionists to fix up some sort of a trap."</p>

<p>"Shiver me! I can't begin to tell you how surprised
I am at the way Cassidy is acting&mdash;that is, if he's gone
into cahoots with this swab of a Fingal for the purpose
of backcapping our plans to save one of our own countrymen.
What sort of a two-faced bandicoot is Cassidy,
anyhow? He must be mighty sore to act like that. But
mayhap you're mistaken, Matt."</p>

<p>"I hope I am," returned Matt gravely. "I always liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Cassidy, and I hate to see a good man go wrong in such
a way as that."</p>

<p>The boys had dropped their voices to an undertone.
While they talked, they hurried ahead along the dim,
winding path, keeping their eyes constantly ahead.</p>

<p>Owing to the close growth of trees, but very little sun
filtered to the ground below, and a twilight gloom hovered
over the narrow way. Matt was in advance, and
suddenly he halted, whirled on Dick and pulled him behind
a matted vine that hung from a tree beside the path.</p>

<p>"Hist!" whispered Matt, in his chum's ear. "I can
hear voices around the turn in the path ahead. Some one
is coming this way. Crouch down and perhaps they'll go
past without seeing us."</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, the two boys knelt behind the
matted vine, each holding his weapon ready in case they
should be discovered and compelled to fight for their
freedom.</p>

<p>It was not long before the men whom Matt had heard
came straggling around the turn in the path. To their
amazement, no less a person than Fingal was at the head
of the column. The light was none too good for making
observations at a distance, but there could be no mistaking
the burly form in the dingy blue cap and coat and
dungaree trousers.</p>

<p>Fingal slouched along with the thwartship roll of a
sailor with stable ground under him. At his back came
half a dozen nondescript men, of various shades of color
from coal black to light yellow.</p>

<p>These men, no doubt, formed part of the rebel army.
They were all barefooted, their clothes were ragged, and
they wore straw hats. Each had a machete strapped
about his waist, but there the uniformity of their accoutrements
ceased. Two had no arms apart from the
machetes; one of the remaining four had a long-barreled,
muzzle-loading rifle, and the other three had revolvers.
Fingal had no rifle, but there was a belt about
his waist that supported a six-shooter over his hip.</p>

<p>The file was still talking as it passed the two boys, but
it was Spanish talk and neither Matt nor Dick could understand
anything that was said.</p>

<p>Without seeing the boys, the file swept on and vanished
around another bend. Matt drew a long breath of
relief.</p>

<p>"We're out of that mess, Dick," he murmured, getting
up and stepping back into the path. "I guess we've settled
all doubts about Cassidy and Fingal. Fingal's here,
and I'll bet something handsome Cassidy can't be very far
off."</p>

<p>"Cassidy's trying to down us," growled Dick, "and
that's as plain as the nose on your face. The old Sou'wegian!
He ought to be trussed up at a grating and
pounded with the 'cat' for this. I never thought it of
the old sorehead! Where do you suppose that pack is
going?"</p>

<p>"They're looking for the <i>Grampus</i>, I guess."</p>

<p>Dick chuckled.</p>

<p>"And the old <i>Grampus</i> is ten feet under water! If
Gaines is next to his job, he's fixed things so they won't
be able to see even the periscope ball."</p>

<p>"Trust Gaines to do everything possible. I don't think
the submarine is in any particular danger, but we couldn't
help her any if she was. We'll keep on and see where
this trouble road lands us."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, old ship! Luck seems to be on our side,
so far, and here's hoping that it will stay with us."</p>

<p>Matt once more took the lead and set the pace. The
ground they were covering had a slight inclination upward,
and the path continued to wriggle, serpent fashion,
through the dense growth of timber.</p>

<p>It was the almost impenetrable screen of the woods
that suddenly plunged the boys into difficulties. Rounding
an abrupt turn, beyond which it was impossible to see
because of the dense foliage, Matt and Dick plunged recklessly
into full view of an encampment. It was a large
encampment, too, and pitched in the midst of a big clearing.
The place was not a hundred yards off, and Matt,
pulling himself short up, got a glimpse of black soldiers
lolling and smoking under rough canvas shelters.</p>

<p>For an instant he halted and stared; then whirled face
about.</p>

<p>"Back, Dick!" he exclaimed. "Run, run for your
life!"</p>

<p>The words were hardly necessary. The boys had been
seen and a wild clamor came from the encampment. A
fizzing sputter of firearms awoke echoes in the timber,
and scraps of lead could be heard slapping and zipping
through the leaves.</p>

<p>"We might be good for three or four," panted Dick, as
he stretched his legs along the path, "but we have to
knock under when the whole rebel army gets after us."</p>

<p>"Save your breath!" cried Matt. "Run!"</p>

<p>"Where'll we run to? That other pack, with Fingal,
is ahead."</p>

<p>"Never mind. The largest force is behind."</p>

<p>The dark-skinned rebels were tearing along like mad.
The boys, looking over their shoulders, could see them
wherever the path straightened out into a short, straight-away
stretch. At such times, too, some one of the pursuing
rabble let fly with a bullet. The bullets went wild,
for there is no such thing as accurate shooting by a man
who is on the run.</p>

<p>The boys were holding their own&mdash;perhaps doing a
little better.</p>

<p>"We can distance 'em," puffed Dick, "if they'll only
give us a little time. We'll be around the next turn and
halfway to the one beyond before they show up again."</p>

<p>Dick had hardly finished speaking before he came to a
sudden halt.</p>

<p>"Keep on!" panted Matt.</p>

<p>"Can't! We're between two fires, matey. That other
gang has heard the firing and is coming back. Let's get
behind trees and do the best we can for ourselves. Oh,
this <i>is</i> a rum go!"</p>

<p>Matt was able to hear the men racing along in advance
of them, and the larger force behind was drawing nearer
and nearer.</p>

<p>The outlook was dark, and the only thing left for the
boys to do seemed to be to dig into the dense undergrowth
and take their chances of being tracked down.</p>

<p>With one accord they sprang toward the left-hand side
of the path. The timber, in that direction, seemed a trifle
less thick than on the right.</p>

<p>Before they had vanished they heard a guarded voice
calling from the right.</p>

<p>"Matt! Motor Matt!"</p>

<p>Startled at hearing his name, the young motorist
paused and whirled about. His astonishment grew. A
woman&mdash;a young woman&mdash;had emerged through the
trailing creepers and was beckoning wildly.</p>

<p>"This way!" she called, still in the same guarded tone.
"Quick, if you want to save yourselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>A moment more and Matt and Dick both recognized
the speaker. She was not one whom they would have
trusted had circumstances been other than they were.
Just then, however, but little choice was left them.</p>

<p>"It's that or nothing," muttered Dick, and he and Matt
charged back across the path and followed the girl into
a tangle of bushes.</p>

<p>Hardly had they vanished when both parties of pursuers
pushed into sight from right and left.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">STRANGE REVELATIONS.</p>


<p>It was in New Orleans that an attractive young lady,
with liquid Spanish eyes, had called to see Motor Matt
and had told him many things which were not true. Because
of this misinformation, Motor Matt had been lured
into the hands of Captain Jim Sixty, the filibuster. The
girl who had been instrumental in carrying out this plot
against the king of the motor boys was Ysabel Sixty, Captain
Sixty's daughter.</p>

<p>The distrust of Matt and Dick, even at the moment
when they were hemmed in on both sides by the revolutionists,
will be understood when it is explained that their
"friend in need" was none other than Ysabel Sixty.</p>

<p>The boys were amazed to see her there in that rebel-haunted
wilderness, but they repressed their excitement
and curiosity until the girl had led them unerringly to a
little cleared space in the heart of the woods.</p>

<p>Here there was a rude shelter constructed of a ragged
tarpaulin, and an <i>olla</i>, or earthen water jar, suspended
from the branches of a tree.</p>

<p>The girl turned and faced the boys as soon as they
reached this primitive camp.</p>

<p>"You are safe, for the present," said she. "I am glad
I could do something to help you."</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky!" growled Dick, his keen eyes on the
girl's face. "Are you helping us, Ysabel Sixty, or luring
us into another trap, like you did up in New Orleans?"</p>

<p>A look of sadness and contrition swept over the girl's
face. It was a pretty face&mdash;not so pretty as it had been
in New Orleans, for now it was worn and haggard&mdash;and
that ripple of sorrow touched it softly.</p>

<p>"I have paid for all that," said the girl slowly. "I
have paid for it with more bitter regrets than I can tell.
Now, maybe, I can help to undo the wrong. What I did
in New Orleans I did not do willingly. My father threatened
to kill me if I failed to carry out his wishes. Now
he is in the hands of the law, you are free, and I am
adrift in this wild country."</p>

<p>There was something in the girl's voice that touched
both Matt and Dick. It could not be that she was again
playing a part, for there was that in her words and manner
which told of sincerity.</p>

<p>"How do you happen to be here?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"My father, as I suppose you have heard, left the
steamer <i>Santa Maria</i> to go on the schooner <i>North Star</i>
and hunt for his water-logged brig. I continued on to
Belize on the <i>Santa Maria</i>, with orders from my father
to take the first boat from Belize to Port Livingstone, at
the mouth of the Izaral. There I was met by some of
General Pitou's soldiers, and brought out to this camp to
wait until my father, or my uncle, should come. My
father did not come, and will not. My uncle has already
arrived, and it is to avoid him that I have come away by
myself, into this part of the woods."</p>

<p>"Who is your uncle, Ysabel?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Abner Fingal."</p>

<p>This took the breath of both of the boys.</p>

<p>"Fingal!" exclaimed Matt.</p>

<p>"His real name is Sixty," explained the girl, "and he
is my father's brother. He is captain of the schooner
that has been helping the revolutionists, and he has sworn
vengeance on all those who had anything to do with my
father's capture."</p>

<p>"That means us, matey," and Dick turned for an apprehensive
look through the timber in the direction of the
path. "I never dreamed of anything like that," he added.</p>

<p>"It's not generally known," said the girl, "that Captain
Fingal and Captain Sixty are in any way related. They
have both been helping the revolutionists, and, if the uprising
was a success, they were to be rewarded."</p>

<p>"You ran away from the rebel camp in order to avoid
Fingal?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why was that?"</p>

<p>A flush ran through the girl's haggard face.</p>

<p>"My uncle wants me to marry General Pitou, a Frenchman
who is in command of the revolutionists. When I
marry," and the words came spitefully and with a stamp
of the foot, "I shall marry to please myself, and not some
one else."</p>

<p>"Right-o, my lass!" approved Dick. "Don't let 'em
bullyrag you into marrying a Frenchie, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I heard that my uncle was expected to reach the camp
soon," went on the girl, "and I ran away last night.
Pedro, a Mexican who used to be a sailor on my father's
brig, helped me to get away. He fixed that little tent for
me, and this morning, when he brought me breakfast, he
told me some news."</p>

<p>"What was that?" inquired Matt, scenting something
of importance.</p>

<p>"Why, Pedro said that my uncle, together with another
man named Cassidy, had come over from Port Livingstone
on a little gasoline boat which they had stolen
from the custom-house officer in the town. They brought
information that a boat that travels under water was coming
to release the American prisoner. Of course," and
the girl smiled a little, "I knew who it was that was coming
in that under-water boat, so I made Pedro tell me
everything he knew.</p>

<p>"He said the boat was coming from Belize, and that
the American consul to British Honduras might come
with it. He told me that Fingal informed the general that
it would be possible to entrap the other consul, and that
this would give the rebels two valuable prisoners to hold
until the American government would exchange Captain
Sixty for them. The plan was to capture the under-water
boat and all on board. Fingal and this man Cassidy
were to have the boat, and Fingal was to be allowed
to do whatever he pleased with all the prisoners except
the consul."</p>

<p>"We know what that meant, matey," said Dick, making
a wry face. "The old hunks wanted to make us walk the
plank for the part we played in the capture of Jim Sixty."</p>

<p>"Pedro said," went on Ysabel, "that General Pitou
doubled the guards all around the camp so that those who
came to rescue Coleman would not only fail, but would
be captured themselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"The plan must have worked out pretty well," observed
Matt. "Did Pedro tell you whether any of the rescuers
had been captured?"</p>

<p>"He came very early this morning," answered Ysabel,
"before the general's plans had been carried out."</p>

<p>"Mr. Coleman is with the insurgents?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"He has been with them for a long time."</p>

<p>"Is he well treated?"</p>

<p>"As well as he can be. The rebels are half starved,
but Mr. Coleman shares their rations with them."</p>

<p>"Where is he kept?"</p>

<p>"In a tent in the middle of the encampment. He is
constantly under guard, but, while I was in the camp, I
was able to talk with him. We were the only ones who
could speak English, and the soldiers were not able to understand
us. I told Mr. Coleman that I was going to run
away, and he said it was the best thing I could do. He
asked me, before I left, to take a letter from him to the
customs officer at Port Livingstone. But he wasn't able
to write the letter before Pedro helped me get away."</p>

<p>Here was great news, but not wholly satisfactory. The
captured consul was alive and well cared for; but he was
also well guarded in the heart of the insurgents' camp.</p>

<p>"That puts me in a blue funk," muttered Dick. "I
wouldn't give a hap'orth for our chances of doing anything
for Coleman. If we get away from here ourselves,
we'll be doing well. And then, too, what's become of
Jordan, Speake and Tirzal? I hate to make a guess, for
it fair dashes me."</p>

<p>Matt was also very much alarmed on account of their
missing companions; in some way, however, he hoped
through Ysabel Sixty to be able to accomplish something&mdash;if
not for Coleman, then at least for Jordan and the
two with him.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to be so close by, Ysabel,"
queried Matt, "when Dick and I were so sorely in need
of help?"</p>

<p>"Pedro said that you would probably make a landing
in the Purgatoire, which is a branch of the Izaral, and
that the general was watching closely the path that led
from the branch to the encampment. I heard a number
of rifle shots, and that led me to hurry toward the path.
I got there just in time to see you. I am sorry for what
I was compelled to do in New Orleans, and if I can help
you any now I wish you would let me."</p>

<p>"You have already been a lot of help to us," said
Matt. "Whether you can help us any more or not remains
to be seen. Perhaps, Ysabel, we may be able to
help <i>you</i> a little."</p>

<p>"How?" she returned, leveling her lustrous black eyes
upon him.</p>

<p>"You can't remain here, in this poor camp, indefinitely,"
went on Matt. "Pedro is taking a good many
chances, I should think, coming here to smuggle food to
you. What would happen if General Pitou was to catch
Pedro? In that case you would be left without any one
to look after you."</p>

<p>"I know that," answered the girl, drawing a long face,
"but anything is better than being compelled to marry
the general. I <i>won't</i> do that!" and again she stamped her
foot angrily.</p>

<p>"What are your plans?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Pedro is going to try and get a pitpan for me and
send me down to Port Livingstone. He says there is a
pitpan on the Purgatoire, and that, just as soon as the
hour is favorable, he will start me for the town."</p>

<p>"That pitpan has been stove in and destroyed," said
Matt, "so you can't count on that. Why not go down
the river with us, in the <i>Grampus</i>? Have you friends in
Port Livingstone?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the girl, a flash of pleasure crossing her
face at Matt's suggestion that she go away in the submarine,
"but I have good friends in Belize&mdash;my mother's
people. They will take care of me. I should have stayed
there instead of coming on to Port Livingstone as my
father told me."</p>

<p>"Then it's settled," said Matt definitely; "we're going
to take you with us when we go."</p>

<p>"When are you going?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Just as soon as we can find out what has become of
the rest of our party and do something to help them."</p>

<p>"The rest of your party? Who are they?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Matt began to tell the girl about Jordan,
Speake and Tirzal, how they had come ashore to reconnoitre
and had not returned. Barely had he finished when
a low whistle, like a signal, floated out of the depths of
the wood. Matt and Dick jumped and clutched their revolvers.</p>

<p>"It's Pedro!" whispered the girl. "You have nothing
to fear from him, but he mustn't see you. Hide&mdash;over
there, behind those bushes&mdash;and wait till he goes away."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick hurried in the direction of the girl's
pointing finger. They had no sooner got safely out of
sight than Pedro came running breathlessly into the little
clearing.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ONE CHANCE IN TEN.</p>


<p>Pedro was as ragged as all the rest of the rebels, but
he was brown, not black or yellow. He was barefooted
and wore on his head a battered straw hat. His only
weapon was a machete, fastened about his waist by a
piece of rope. He was a man of middle age, and from
his manner there was not the least doubt of his loyalty
to the daughter of his former captain. He carried a
small parcel, knotted up in a dusty handkerchief, and laid
it on the ground near the water jar; then, drawing off
and keeping close watch of the timber behind him, he
began speaking hurriedly in Spanish.</p>

<p>The girl's face lighted up as she listened. Once in a
while she interrupted the torrent of words pouring from
Pedro's lips to put in a question, then subsided and let
the torrent flow on.</p>

<p>For five minutes, perhaps, Pedro talked and gesticulated.
At the end of that time he pulled off his tattered
hat, extracted a scrap of folded paper from the crown
and handed it to the girl. Then, with a quick, low-spoken
"<i>Adios!</i>" he vanished into the forest.</p>

<p>As soon as he was safely away, Ysabel turned toward
the bushes where the boys had been concealed and clapped
her hands.</p>

<p>"Come!" she called; "I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick hurried to join her.</p>

<p>"What's it about?" asked Dick eagerly.</p>

<p>"It's about your friends, of whom you were telling me
when Pedro came. They have been captured&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keelhaul me! There's nothing very pleasing about
that."</p>

<p>"Didn't you expect it?" the girl asked. "You knew
something must have happened to them when they failed
to return to the boat."</p>

<p>"Yes," spoke up Matt, "we expected it, but I think
both of us had a hope that they had merely been pursued
into the wood and were working their way back to the
<i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>"The men General Pitou had set to watch the path
from the Purgatoire were the ones who captured them.
Mr. Jordan had time to fire just one shot before they
were seized, but that bullet wounded a captain, one of
the general's best men. Pedro says General Pitou is very
angry, and that he is going to keep all the prisoners and
not release them until the United States government gives
up my father."</p>

<p>"The government will never do that," said Matt.
"Our country is too big to be bullied by a handful of
rebels, 'way down here in Central America."</p>

<p>"Then General Pitou says the prisoners will all be
killed."</p>

<p>There was little doubt in Matt's mind but that this
irresponsible rebel general would be reckless enough to
carry out his threat.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we've made a monkey's fist of this, all right,"
growled Dick. "We come down here to rescue Coleman,
and, instead of doing that, we leave Jordan, Speake and
Tirzal in the enemy's hands. A nice run of luck this is!"</p>

<p>Matt was equally cast down.</p>

<p>"Tirzal is to be shot as a spy," went on Ysabel.</p>

<p>"Poor chap! But what could you expect? I hope the
president of this two-by-twice republic will capture every
man-jack of the rebels and bowse every last one of them
up to the yardarm. That's what they're entitled to, from
General Pitou down."</p>

<p>"Did Pedro have anything to say about us?" inquired
Matt.</p>

<p>"That's where the good part of it comes in," went on
the girl. "The rebels think you're in the woods, somewhere
to the north of the path. All the general's force,
excepting about twenty-five armed men who are guarding
the prisoners at the encampment, are hunting
through the timber in the hope of catching you. Fingal
is helping in the search, and vows he will make you pay
dearly for the part you played in the capture of my
father."</p>

<p>"I fail to see anything pleasant in all this, even yet,"
continued Dick. "I thought you said that here was
where the good part comes in?"</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" cried the girl. "If all the rebels, outside
the encampment, are looking for you in the timber
the other side of the path, why, that leaves the way clear
to the submarine. We can go there, right off, and get
away from General Pitou and his men."</p>

<p>There was a short silence after this. Matt and Dick
were both turning the subject over in their minds. When
their eyes sought each other, dogged determination could
be read in each glance.</p>

<p>"As you say, Ysabel," said Matt, "we have an opportunity
to get back to the submarine, but we can't go and
leave our friends behind us."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;can't&mdash;go?" breathed the girl, staring at Matt
as though she scarcely understood his words. "Why
can't you go?" she went on, almost fiercely. "Your
friends are captured, and how can you hope to get them
away from twenty-five armed men? Don't be so foolish!
Get away while you can&mdash;pretty soon it will be too
late, and if you are caught you will be shot."</p>

<p>"What's in that handkerchief, Ysabel?" queried Dick,
pointing to the parcel Pedro had placed on the ground
near the water jar.</p>

<p>"Food," said the girl curtly. "Eat it, if you want to.
I'm not hungry."</p>

<p>She was in a temper because Matt and Dick would not
hurry away to the submarine. She could not understand
why they should delay their flight when it was manifestly
impossible for them to be of any help to their captured
friends. As if to further emphasize her displeasure, she
turned her back on the boys.</p>

<p>Dick stared at her, and then swerved an amused glance
upon his chum.</p>

<p>"Didn't Pedro give you a note, Ysabel?" asked Matt
gently.</p>

<p>"Yes. It was from Coleman. He managed to write it
and give it to Pedro for me. It is mine."</p>

<p>"Suppose you read it? Perhaps there is something in
it that is important."</p>

<p>Ysabel partly turned and threw the note on the ground
at Matt's feet.</p>

<p>"You can read it," she said.</p>

<p>Matt picked up the scrap and opened it out. It was
written in lead pencil, on the back of an old envelope.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I hope you can get away some time to-day in that
pitpan Pedro was telling you about. If you can do that,
you can help all the prisoners now in General Pitou's
hands. Some time soon we are to be taken down the
Izaral halfway to Port Livingstone, where the rebels
have another camp which they consider safer than this
one. We will all go in the gasoline launch which was
stolen, early this morning, by Fingal and Cassidy. Tell
this to the customs officer at Port Livingstone, and ask
him to do his best to intercept the launch and help us. I
cannot write more&mdash;I have not time."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the note.</p>

<p>"Shiver me!" muttered Dick dejectedly, "if the old
cutthroat, Pitou, has his prisoners taken farther back in
the jungle, there'll be no possibility of rescuing them.
We're on the reefs now, for sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt turned to Ysabel. Her anger was passing as
quickly as it had mounted, and she seemed anxious to
meet any question Matt should ask her.</p>

<p>"When Fingal and Cassidy came up the river in the
gasoline launch," said Matt, "did they turn into the
Purgatoire branch?"</p>

<p>"No. Pedro said that they went on up the Izaral, and
got across to the encampment by another road through
the woods."</p>

<p>"Then, if the prisoners are brought down in the launch
they'll have to pass the mouth of the Purgatoire?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Dick," said Matt, "there's a chance that we can do
something to that boat load of prisoners."</p>

<p>"What?" queried Dick, pricking up his ears.</p>

<p>"We can go back to the submarine, drop down the
Purgatoire and wait there, submerged, until the gasoline
launch comes down."</p>

<p>"Then what, matey?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Then we'll do whatever we can. There'll be five of
us on the submarine, and I don't see why we couldn't
accomplish something."</p>

<p>But Dick shook his head.</p>

<p>"You don't know, matey," said he, "that Coleman's
information is correct. It's hardly likely that Pitou would
blow the gaff to one of his prisoners."</p>

<p>"Coleman may have found it out in some other way
than from General Pitou."</p>

<p>"Well, the launch may already have dropped down the
river."</p>

<p>"Hardly, I think, when most of the rebels are out looking
for us. There's a chance, Dick."</p>

<p>"One chance in ten, I should say, matey."</p>

<p>"That's better than no chance at all, which seems to
be what we have here."</p>

<p>"We've worse than no chance at all, out in this scrub
with the rebel army looking for us. If we're caught, we'll
be done browner than a kippered herring. Although I
haven't much hope, I'm for making a quick slant in the
direction of the <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>"Then you're going to the submarine?" asked Ysabel
joyfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we'd better start at once while the coast
seems to be clear."</p>

<p>The girl clapped her hands and started for the timber.</p>

<p>"Do you want this?" asked Dick, lifting the bundle
from beside the water jar.</p>

<p>"No, it's only food&mdash;my dinner that Pedro brought me.
You have plenty on the submarine, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"Then hang that to a tree branch for Pedro. Probably
he robbed himself to help me. He'll come back and get
it."</p>

<p>Dick twisted the knots of the handkerchief into the
end of a branch and they all started hurriedly back toward
the path.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the way made it necessary for them
to travel in single file. Matt went ahead, Ysabel followed
him, and Dick brought up the rear.</p>

<p>In ten minutes they were back in the path and hurrying
swiftly in the direction of the Purgatoire. But ill
luck was still following them, like an evil spectre.</p>

<p>They had not gone far along the course before a rebel
soldier sprang from the timber into the path at Matt's
side.</p>

<p>The surprise was mutual, and, for an instant, Matt and
the negro stared at each other. Fortunately the negro
had no firearms. He drew his machete, but before he
could aim a stroke with it, Matt had leaped forward and
struck his arm a fierce blow with the butt of Jordan's
revolver.</p>

<p>A yell of pain fell from the negro's lips, his arm
dropped at his side and he jumped backward into the
woods.</p>

<p>"Quick," shouted Matt to those behind. "There may
be others with him and we'll have to make a dash for the
<i>Grampus</i>. Run on ahead, Dick, and get the submarine
up and close to the bank. I'll follow you with Ysabel."</p>

<p>Dick would have demurred at this arrangement, but a
chorus of wild yells, issuing from the wood, proved that
the negro had spread the alarm.</p>

<p>"The boat will be ready for you," shouted Dick, as he
passed like a streak along the path.</p>

<p>Seizing the girl's arm, and keeping the revolver in
hand, Matt started on as rapidly as the girl could go.</p>

<p>Ysabel made poor work of the flight.</p>

<p>"Go on," she begged; "don't try to save me. You can
get away if you don't have to bother to help me along."</p>

<p>"I'll not leave you," answered Matt firmly, taking a
quick look over his shoulder. "The soldiers have not yet
reached the path and there's a good chance for us. Do
your best, Ysabel!"</p>

<p>The girl struggled along as well as she could, Matt
bounding ahead and dragging her by main force. The
shouts behind were growing louder. A rifle was fired and
the bullet hissed spitefully through the air above their
heads.</p>

<p>"Fingal will kill you if he catches you," panted the
girl.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to let him catch me," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"He will catch you if you try to take me with you!
Leave me, I say. I won't be hurt. Perhaps, if I turn
around and run toward them, I can do something to help
save you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're wasting your breath," said Matt finally. "Save
it for running."</p>

<p>Ysabel was a girl who was accustomed, in some things,
to having her way. She thought that, if Matt persisted
in burdening himself with her, he would surely be captured,
and she was anxious to save him at all costs.
Thus, in a fashion, she could atone for what she had
done in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while Matt was dragging her onward, she
threw herself upon the ground.</p>

<p>"I can't go another step!" she cried breathlessly.
"Leave me and save yourself."</p>

<p>He made no reply, but bent down and picked the girl
up in his arms. Then, thus burdened, he staggered on
along the path.</p>

<p>The pursuers were coming closer and closer. Two or
three shots rang out, so close together that they sounded
almost as one. Matt stumbled and nearly fell.</p>

<p>"You're hurt!" cried the girl, noticing how his left
arm dropped at his side, releasing her.</p>

<p>"Nicked, that's all," he answered. "The shock of it
came near to taking the strength out of me for an instant.
I'm all right now, although the arm isn't much
good for the present."</p>

<p>"I'll run along beside you," said the girl, in a strangely
subdued tone.</p>

<p>Her ruse to get Matt to leave her&mdash;for ruse it was&mdash;had
not succeeded. On the contrary, it had cost Matt
something. The girl, all contrition, ran at his side and
did much better than she had done before.</p>

<p>A turn in the woods put them out of sight of their
pursuers and presented a screen against the vicious
firearms.</p>

<p>"Just a little farther," breathed the girl. "The river
is close now."</p>

<p>"We'll make it," returned Matt cheerily.</p>

<p>His face was a trifle pale, but the same dogged look
was in his gray eyes which, more than once, had snatched
victory from seeming defeat.</p>

<p>"Does your arm hurt, Matt?" the girl asked.</p>

<p>"It's feeling better now," and Matt lifted it.</p>

<p>A little stream of red had run down his hand. The
girl stifled a cry as she looked.</p>

<p>He laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"A scratch, that's all," he assured her. "Let's see how
quick we can get around that next turn. When we pass
that, we'll have a straight run to the river."</p>

<p>They called on every ounce of their reserve strength,
and were around the bend before their enemies had had
a chance to do any more firing.</p>

<p>Matt was wondering, during that last lap of their run,
whether they were to be defeated at the very finish of
their plucky flight.</p>

<p>They had delayed too long in leaving the girl's camp.
He saw that, plainly enough, and yet he would not have
started back to the boat at all unless he had received the
news contained in Coleman's note.</p>

<p>Had Dick reached the river in time to attract the attention
of those on the submarine and have the craft
brought to the surface, ready and waiting for Matt and
the girl?</p>

<p>If not, if the slightest thing had gone wrong and caused
a delay, then Matt and his companion must surely fall
into the hands of Fingal and General Pitou.</p>

<p>Yet, harassed though he was by these doubts, Matt's
nerve did not for a moment desert him.</p>

<p>The rebels were behind them, and firing, when he and
Ysabel reached the bank of the river. But the soldiers
were firing wildly now, and their bullets did not come
anywhere near their living targets.</p>

<p>And there, plainly under Matt's eyes, was the
<i>Grampus</i>. She was at the surface, he could hear the
throb of her working motor, and Dick was forward,
swinging back on the cable and holding her against the
bank. Carl was half out of the conning tower, tossing
his hands frantically.</p>

<p>"Hurry oop! hurry oop!" clamored Carl. "Don'd led
dose fellers ged you, Matt. Schust a leedle furder
und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt was about to yell for Carl to drop out of the
tower and clear the way, but a bullet, fanning the air
close to Carl's head, caused him to disappear suddenly.</p>

<p>"You'll make it!" yelled Dick, reaching over to help
the girl to the rounded steel deck.</p>

<p>"Into the tower hatch with you, Ysabel!" cried Matt.
"Help her, Dick," he added. "There's no use hanging
onto the rope now."</p>

<p>As Matt scrambled to the deck, the impetus of his leap
flung the bow of the submarine away from the bank.
Dick was already pushing and supporting Ysabel toward
the tower hatch.</p>

<p>The bullets were now flying too thickly for comfort,
but Matt drew a long breath of relief when he saw the
girl disappear behind the protection of the tower.</p>

<p>"In with you, Dick!" shouted Matt, the <i>pingity-ping</i>
of bullets on the steel deck giving point to his words.</p>

<p>"But you're hurt, matey," answered Dick.</p>

<p>"No time to talk!" was Matt's brief response.</p>

<p>Dick, without delaying matters further, dropped
through the top of the tower. The firing suddenly ceased.
As Matt mounted the tower and threw his feet over the
rim, he saw the reason.</p>

<p>Four of the ragged soldiers had leaped from the bank
to the submarine's deck. More would have come, but
the gap of water had grown too wide for them to leap
across it. These four, scrambling and stumbling toward
Matt, caused their comrades to hold their fire for fear
of injuring them.</p>

<p>Just as Matt dropped down the iron ladder, the foremost
of the negro soldiers reached the tower. His big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
hands seized the rim as he made ready to hoist himself
upward and follow the fugitives into the interior of the
boat.</p>

<p>Matt had yet to close the hatch, and the negro's hands
were in the way. With his clenched fist he struck the
black fingers. His work was somewhat hampered from
the fact that his left arm was still not to be depended
on, so he had to use his right hand entirely.</p>

<p>With a howl of pain the negro pulled away his hands.
Thereupon, quick as a flash, Matt reached upward and
closed the hatch. Not a moment too soon was this accomplished,
for the other three soldiers had reached the
tower and were preparing to assist their comrade.</p>

<p>Matt pushed into place the lever holding the hatch
shut.</p>

<p>"Fill the ballast tanks!" he shouted. "Pass the word
to Clackett, Dick. Lively, now! Ten-foot submersion!
We've got to clear the decks of these negroes. If they
should break one of the lunettes we'd be in a serious fix."</p>

<p>Down below him Matt could hear Dick roaring his
order to Clackett. With eyes against one of the narrow
windows Matt watched the rebel soldiers.</p>

<p>They were beating on the hatch cover with their fists,
and kicking against the sides of the tower. On the bank,
their comrades were running along to keep abreast of the
boat and shouting suggestions.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i>, steered by Dick with the aid of the periscope,
had turned her nose down-stream in the direction
of the Izaral.</p>

<p>The hissing of air escaping from the ballast tanks as
the water came in was heard by the four ragamuffins on
the outside of the steel shell.</p>

<p>From their actions, they began to feel alarm. This
strange craft was more than their primitive minds could
comprehend.</p>

<p>Slowly the submarine began to sink. As the water
crept up the rounded deck, the negroes lifted their bare
feet out of it gingerly and pushed up higher. One of
them leaped onto the conning-tower hatch.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the <i>Grampus</i> dropped below the water.
A mud-colored blur closed Matt's view through the
lunette, and as he slid down the ladder into the periscope
room, he heard faint yells from the negroes.</p>

<p>Dick, hanging over the periscope table, twirling the
steering wheel, was laughing loudly.</p>

<p>"Look, Matt!" he cried. "If you ever saw a lot of
scared Sambos, there they are, up there in the Purgatoire!"</p>

<p>Matt stepped to Dick's side and peered down upon the
mirror. Far behind, in the trail of bubbles sent up from
the <i>Grampus</i>, the four negroes were swimming like mad
toward the shore. Their comrades on the bank were
leaning out to help them, and it was evident that they
would all be saved.</p>

<p>"We can laugh at the affair now," said Matt, "yet it
was anything but a laughing matter a while ago. Eh,
Ysabel?"</p>

<p>"You saved me, Motor Matt," replied the girl, "and
now let us see how badly you are hurt."</p>

<p>"A bandage will fix that in a little while, Ysabel,"
said the other; "just now I've got something else to attend
to, and the arm can wait."</p>

<p>Turning back to the periscope, he watched the river
bank sliding away behind them, and waited for the moment
when they should draw close to the Izaral.</p>

<p>Their work&mdash;the work which they had one chance in
ten of accomplishing&mdash;must be looked after.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.</p>


<p>Ysabel sank down on the top of the locker. Carl had
turned on the electric light in the periscope room and was
staring at the girl in unconcealed amazement.</p>

<p>"How vas dis?" he asked. "Miss Harris, iss it you,
sure enough?"</p>

<p>"Not Miss Harris," answered the girl with a flush,
"but Miss Ysabel Sixty."</p>

<p>"You bed you," returned Carl, slightly abashed. "Miss
Sixdy, dis vas kevite a surbrise. I hat no itee dot you
vas in dis part oof der vorld. How id vas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Slow down your motor, Gaines!" shouted Matt,
through one of the tubes. "Make ready the bow anchor,
there, Clackett&mdash;you don't need to bother with the tanks,
because we're going to anchor under the surface. Carl,"
he added, turning to his Dutch chum, "below with you
and make ready to let go the stern anchor when I give
the word. Sharp on it now!"</p>

<p>Carl jumped for the bulkhead door leading to the after-part
of the ship.</p>

<p>Every one on board, with the exception of Dick and
Ysabel, were astounded at these maneuvres of Motor
Matt's. However, Matt was in charge, and all hands
obeyed him without question.</p>

<p>With his eyes on the periscope, Matt stood and
watched, now and then calling a direction to Dick, at the
wheel.</p>

<p>When the <i>Grampus</i> shot from the Purgatoire into the
Izaral, she went broadside on against the current of the
larger stream. The steel hull heaved over a little under
the mass of flowing water, but the screw and the rudder
held her stiffly to her course.</p>

<p>"Now," shouted Matt into the speaking tube, "let go
your anchors!"</p>

<p>The swishing clank of chains, paying out under water,
came to the ears of those in the periscope room.</p>

<p>"Anchor's down!" cried Clackett.</p>

<p>"Dot's der same here!" yelled Carl, his voice ringing
from aft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop the motor, Gaines!" ordered Matt.</p>

<p>The humming of the cylinders ceased, and the
<i>Grampus</i>, anchored broadside on across the Izaral, tugged
at her mooring chains.</p>

<p>"Where are we, Matt?" came the voice of Gaines
through the motor-room tube. "I thought we were making
a run to get away from the revolutionists."</p>

<p>"Hardly, Gaines," answered Matt. "We don't want
to run away and leave our friends in the hands of the
rebels. Come into the periscope room, all of you, and
I'll explain what we are doing and why we are doing
it."</p>

<p>"And while you're explaining," said Ysabel quietly but
firmly, "I'll take care of your arm. Where is something
I can use for a bandage? And I'd like a sponge and a
basin of water."</p>

<p>"You'll find a bandage in that locker you're sitting on,
Ysabel," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I'll get the water," said Dick.</p>

<p>By the time Matt had been divested of his coat, and
had had his shirt sleeve rolled up, Gaines, Clackett and
Carl were in the periscope room, sitting on the low stools
that served for chairs. Dick was back, also, with the
basin of water and the sponge, and Ysabel began dressing
the wounded arm.</p>

<p>"Great guns, Matt!" exclaimed Gaines. "Are you
hurt?"</p>

<p>"A scratch, nothing more," Matt answered. "The
bullet simply left a mark and then went on. I brought
you up here, friends," the young motorist continued, "to
tell you where we are. We're anchored, broadside on
to the current, in the middle of the Izaral River, our
periscope ball some three or four feet above the surface
of the water. We are going to stay here and wait for
something to happen."</p>

<p>"What's to happen?" asked Clackett.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got news that a motor launch is coming
down the Izaral loaded with prisoners. If possible, we
must intercept the launch. Dick says we've a chance in
ten of winning out, but we can't neglect even so slim a
chance as that, inasmuch as it happens to be our only
one."</p>

<p>Gaines, Clackett and Carl were even more deeply puzzled
than they had been.</p>

<p>"Who are the prisoners?" inquired Gaines.</p>

<p>"Coleman, for one&mdash;the man we came to rescue. Then
there are Jordan, Speake, and, I hope, Tirzal."</p>

<p>"Jordan and those with him were really captured?" demanded
Clackett.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber, vat a luck!" wailed Carl. "Ve come
afder vone Amerigan consul und lose anodder! Dey vas
hootoos, dose consuls."</p>

<p>Matt, carefully watching the periscope as he talked,
repeated the experiences that had overtaken him and Dick
while they were reconnoitring to find some trace of Jordan's
party.</p>

<p>The presence of Ysabel had aroused much curiosity in
all of them, and the explanation as to how she came to
be on the boat straightened out that part of the matter
to the satisfaction of every one. Carl, in particular, was
highly pleased. He had dried himself out, after his fall
in the river, and was feeling easy in his mind, now that
Matt and Dick, at least, had been kept out of the hands
of General Pitou.</p>

<p>"You dit a pig t'ing, Miss Sixdy," said Carl, "ven
you safed Matt und Tick, und Matt dit some more pig
t'ings ven he safed you, so dot vas efen. Now, oof ve
don'd make some misdakes in our galgulations und are
aple to resgue dot poat loadt oof brisoners, eferypody vill
be so habby as I can'd dell. Oof gourse, I don'd vas
in id, ad all. I hat my drouple mit an allikator, und hat
to shday pehindt und dake care oof der supmarine."</p>

<p>"Do you feel pretty sure, Matt," queried Gaines, "that
the motor launch with the prisoners will come down the
Izaral?"</p>

<p>"All we have to go on, Gaines, is Coleman's note," answered
Matt. "I may say that this move constitutes our
only hope. If something doesn't happen, about as we
expect and hope it will, then we'll have to give up all
thought of doing anything for Coleman, or our friends."</p>

<p>"We'll hope something will happen, mate," said Dick.
"In case the launch comes down the river, what are you
intending to do?"</p>

<p>"I have my plans, Dick," said Matt. "If every one
carries out his orders on the jump, I feel pretty sure the
plan will carry. The main thing is to keep a keen watch
for the launch."</p>

<p>"That's easy enough during daylight, with the periscope
ball elevated as it is," remarked Gaines, "but if the launch
happens to come down-stream in the night&mdash;which, it
strikes me, is altogether likely&mdash;then the boat is apt to get
past us."</p>

<p>"Not if a good lookout is kept."</p>

<p>"How will you keep a good lookout if you don't go to
the surface?"</p>

<p>"Well, what the eye can't see the ear will have to tell
us. The hollow ball and the hollow periscope mast will
bring the <i>chug</i> of the motor boat's engine into the submarine.
The craft ought to be heard a good distance
away. One man will have to be at the periscope all the
time, and all the rest of you must be at your stations,
ready to carry out orders at a second's notice. You go
down to the motor room, Gaines, and Clackett, you go to
the tank room. I will stay on the lookout. At midnight,
I will have Carl and Dick relieve both of you, but all
hands must be on the alert to turn out at a moment's
warning. Carl will get some supper for us, and pass it
around."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt, as usual, had made no arrangement whereby he
could secure any rest for himself. But he felt that he
could not rest, even if he had the chance.</p>

<p>The rescue of Coleman meant much to Captain Nemo,
Jr., for on the performance of the <i>Grampus</i> might depend
the sale of the submarine to the United States government.
While the failure to rescue Coleman, and even the
loss of Jordan, Speake and the pilot had nothing to do
with the boat's capabilities, yet failure, nevertheless, would
spoil a sale and fill the authorities in Washington with
distrust.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i> was not a passenger boat, and she had
now a lady passenger to take care of. Matt finally solved
the difficulty by having Ysabel conducted to a small steel
room abaft the periscope chamber. This was set aside
entirely for the girl's use, and she arranged a fairly comfortable
bed on the floor.</p>

<p>After supper had been eaten, Ysabel retired to her
cabin, and Carl and Dick nodded drowsily on the looker
in the periscope room. Matt, wide awake as a hawk, kept
his eyes on the periscope table and his ears attuned for
the first sound of the launch's motor.</p>

<p>Night, however, closed in without bringing any sign
of the boat. The gloom, of course, put the periscope out
of commission as it deepened, but still Matt watched the
table top, looking for possible lights and listening for the
clank of machinery.</p>

<p>Dick took Matt's place for an hour or two, while Matt
lay down and tried to sleep. Although he had had only
three hours' sleep in two days, yet the young motorist
found it impossible to lose himself in slumber. He was
keyed up to too high a pitch, and was too worried.</p>

<p>At midnight he sent Dick and Carl to relieve Gaines
and Clackett, and was alone with his vigils in the periscope
room.</p>

<p>From midnight on the night seemed an eternity; and
the gloomy hours passed without anything happening.
Matt had believed with Gaines that night would be the
time the captors would choose for coming down the river
with their captives. Inasmuch as they had not come,
did this mean that they were not coming at all? that
General Pitou had changed his plans?</p>

<p>Desperately Matt clung to his last shred of hope and
watched the coming day reflect itself in a gray haze over
the top of the periscope table.</p>

<p>Slowly the trees along the river stood out with constantly
increasing distinctness, and the bosom of the rolling
river took form beneath his eyes. Up-stream he could
see nothing, but&mdash;what was that he heard?</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, he gripped at the table top and
listened intently. <i>Chuggety-chug</i>, <i>chuggety-chug</i>&mdash;there
was absolutely no doubt of it! A motor boat was coming
down-stream&mdash;his ears had heard it before the periscope
had been able to pick it up.</p>

<p>"At your stations, everybody!" Matt shouted. "Dick!
up here in the periscope room with you! <i>The motor
launch is coming!</i>"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTOR MATT'S GREAT PLAY.</p>


<p>Instantly all was commotion on board the submarine,
but it was orderly commotion. Clackett jumped to his
ballast tanks, Gaines "turned his engine over," and Carl
and Dick hastened into the periscope room.</p>

<p>"Aft with you, Carl," called Matt, "and stand by to
take in the stern anchor. Clackett," and Matt's lips
passed to the tube leading to the tank room, "forward,
and be ready for the bow anchor. Dick," Matt's eyes
were again on the periscope table, "bring all the loose
coils of rope you can find and lay them on the locker."</p>

<p>Dick had no notion what the ropes were wanted for,
but he went for them, and soon had four coils laid along
the top of the locker. After that, he passed to the steering
wheel, standing shoulder to shoulder beside Matt in
front of the periscope table.</p>

<p>There was an atmosphere of expectancy all through
the submarine. Every nerve was strained, and each person
stood at his post almost with bated breath. Ysabel,
without speaking, came into the periscope room and
watched Matt with steady eyes.</p>

<p>"There she is!" cried Dick, his eyes on the periscope
mirror; "I see her coming!"</p>

<p>Matt also saw the motor launch, breaking into sight
against the background of indistinct foliage, far up the
stream. The boat was comparatively small, and well
loaded. Fingal was in the bow thwarts, with a rifle
across his knees; in the stern was Cassidy and a negro
soldier, both likewise armed with rifles. Between Fingal,
and Cassidy and the negro, were the prisoners. There
were four of them&mdash;Jordan, Speake, Tirzal and a slender,
full-bearded man in a battered solar hat. Cassidy
was close to the gasoline engine and was evidently looking
after it. Fingal, from the bow, was doing the steering.</p>

<p>"They're all there," said Matt, in a calm, matter-of-fact
tone. "Come here, Ysabel."</p>

<p>The girl stepped obediently to his side. Matt pointed
to one of the prisoners reflected in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Is that Coleman?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer.</p>

<p>"You'd better go back and sit down, Ysabel," said
Matt. "Pretty soon we're going to need all the space
we have in this vicinity."</p>

<p>Matt was easy, almost smiling. A great relief had
come to him, for the launch was in sight with four captives
and three captors, and now it lay with Matt alone
whether his friends and Coleman should be released or
not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you do something, matey?" implored Dick,
his hands shaking with excitement.</p>

<p>"I'm waiting for the right time," was the cool answer.</p>

<p>"We've only two revolvers," muttered Dick, "and
there are three rifles in that boat. What can we do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing with firearms. We've got to make a different
play, Dick."</p>

<p>A moment longer Matt waited, studying the approach
of the launch with calculating eyes; then, suddenly, he
turned.</p>

<p>"In with the anchors, Clackett, you and Carl," he
called. "See how quick you can get them off the bottom.
Start your engine, Gaines," he added.</p>

<p>The lifting of the anchors caused the <i>Grampus</i> to
drift with the current. But only for a moment. Soon
the screw took the push and Dick, under orders from
Matt, headed the craft up-stream and the propeller
worked just fast enough to hold her steady.</p>

<p>"Anchor's stowed!" called Clackett.</p>

<p>"Same vay mit me!" came from Carl.</p>

<p>"Jump for the tank room, Clackett!" called Matt.
"Carl, up here with you."</p>

<p>As Carl came rolling excitedly into the periscope room,
Clackett reported, by tube, that he was back at his usual
post.</p>

<p>Matt turned to Dick.</p>

<p>"Keep the <i>Grampus</i> pointed for the launch, Dick," said
he. "Carl, take a coil of rope and climb to the conning-tower
hatch. The moment the tower's awash, open the
hatch, get out on the deck and do what you can with the
rope."</p>

<p>Carl was bewildered. What was he to do with the
rope? "I don'd know no more as a mu-el," he said to
himself, but nevertheless he obeyed orders.</p>

<p>Matt continued to watch the periscope table and to calculate.
Then, again suddenly, he whirled to the tube
communicating with the tank chamber.</p>

<p>"Empty the tanks by compressed air, Clackett!" he
called. "See how quick you can do it! <i>Everything depends
on you!</i>"</p>

<p>The hiss of the air was heard ejecting the water. The
submarine began to rise.</p>

<p>"Bring her up under the launch, Dick!" cried Matt.
"Make no mistake, old chap! <i>Under the launch</i>, mind!"</p>

<p>A thrill ran through Dick Ferral's nerves. At last he
understood what his old raggie was about! Had he had
time, Dick would have liked to give Motor Matt a hug
from sheer admiration.</p>

<p>"When the tanks are empty," shouted Matt to Clackett,
"come up, take a coil of rope and rush for the deck."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" called Clackett.</p>

<p>The periscope revealed a strange situation. The launch
was almost upon the periscope ball. Too late those in the
motor boat recognized the device. Before the boat could
sheer off, the <i>Grampus</i> had risen under her bodily and
lifted her clear of the water. The steel hull of the
submarine shivered, and wild cries came from those in
the motor boat.</p>

<p>Dick grabbed a coil of rope and leaped for the iron
ladder.</p>

<p>"Up with the hatch, Carl!" he yelled. "Out on the
deck and see how many you can pull out of the river."</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" cried Carl, wrenching back on the lever
and throwing up the dripping hatch cover.</p>

<p>He scrambled out.</p>

<p>"Steer from the tower, Dick," Matt called, racing up
the ladder, "as soon as the hatchway is cleared."</p>

<p>Clackett followed Matt, and Ysabel Sixty followed
Clackett. The thrill of the moment was in the girl's
nerves. She could not have held herself back if she had
wanted to. Armed with a coil of rope, she climbed over
the rim of the hatch and onto the slippery plates of the
deck.</p>

<p>What Matt saw, when he struck the deck, was an overturned
launch in the water, and two men clinging to the
bow of the <i>Grampus</i>. One of these was Cassidy, and the
other was Tirzal. The former was clinging to the flagstaff,
and the other to one of the wire cable guys. By an
accident, they had held to the curved deck instead of slipping
back into the water.</p>

<p>Dick, from the tower, was able to direct the boat so
as to facilitate the picking up of those in the river.</p>

<p>Carl tossed a rope to Speake, Matt got one to Coleman,
and Clackett succeeded in getting a line in the hands
of Jordan. Ysabel tossed one end of her rope to Fingal,
but he flung it aside with an oath. The negro soldier
reached for it, but Fingal struck his hand fiercely aside,
seized the soldier by the neck and began swimming with
him toward the river bank.</p>

<p>While the rescued prisoners were being hauled aboard,
Matt watched Fingal and the negro. The current was
swift, but both men were strong swimmers. To Matt's
satisfaction he saw the two gain the bank and get safely
upon dry ground. Fingal's move was characteristic of
him, for, as soon as he could lift himself, he shook his
clenched fist at the submarine and those on her deck.
If he had had a rifle, undoubtedly he would have done
some shooting.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt!" cried Jordan.</p>

<p>He was sitting on the deck, his back against the side
of the conning tower, shaking the water out of his ears.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Did you come up under that launch by accident, or
did you do it purposely?"</p>

<p>"I had that all figured out, Jordan," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"It was the greatest play I ever heard of!"</p>

<p>"It was the only one we could make that would stand
any show of winning. When you, and Speake, and Tirzal
left the <i>Grampus</i>, you took all the rifles. We were left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with only a brace of six-shooters. Of course I knew
better than to try to get the best of Fingal, Cassidy and
the soldier with two popguns when they were armed with
rifles."</p>

<p>"Of course you did!" chuckled Jordan. "I'm as wet
as a drowned rat, but I'm happy&mdash;oh, yes, happier than
I ever thought I should be, a few minutes back. By the
way, Matt, that gentleman with the dripping whiskers is
Jeremiah Coleman, the fellow we came to rescue, and
just missed leaving a few more prisoners to keep him
company. Jerry, shake hands with Motor Matt. He
was cracked up pretty high in those messages from New
Orleans, and I must say that he fills the bill."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you, Motor Matt," smiled Coleman, as
he leaned to take Matt's hand. "You've done a fine
thing for all of us, and it's something that won't be forgotten
in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Dose iss der kindt oof t'ings vat he alvays does,"
bubbled Carl.</p>

<p>"Cassidy and Tirzal seem to have come aboard without
gettin' wet," remarked Clackett, with a glance of
contempt in the direction of the mate.</p>

<p>Cassidy sat on the deck with his head bowed, as abject
a figure as Matt ever saw.</p>

<p>"Which way now, Matt?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Belize," replied Matt. "Go down the ladder and let
Tirzal take the wheel until we all get below; after that,
Tirzal can steer from the tower. Go below, gentlemen,"
said Dick. "You'll feel more comfortable after you dry
your clothes, and then we can have a talkfest. There are
a lot of things I've got to find out."</p>

<p>Ysabel led the descent into the periscope room; Coleman
followed her, then Tirzal, then Speake, and then
Jordan. Clackett and Carl brought up the rear of the
procession, both, with their eyes, telling the melancholy
Cassidy what they thought of him as they dropped down
the tower hatch.</p>

<p>"Better go below, Cassidy," said Matt calmly.</p>

<p>For answer, the mate jerked a revolver from a belt at
his waist and lifted the muzzle to his breast.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, Matt had hurled himself across the
slippery deck and knocked the weapon out of Cassidy's
hand.</p>

<p>"You're less of a man than I thought you, Cassidy,"
cried Matt contemptuously, "to think of such a thing
as that!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE WAY TO BELIZE.</p>


<p>"What have I got left to live for?" scowled Cassidy,
looking up into Matt's face. "I turned against the best
friend I ever had just because he had sense enough to put
a better head than mine in charge of the <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>"You took to drinking," said Matt. "That, I think,
was at the bottom of what you did. But I don't harbor
any ill will, and I don't believe Captain Nemo, Jr., will,
either."</p>

<p>"He'll never overlook this," muttered Cassidy, shaking
his head. "An' it was him that pulled me out of the
gutter, up there in Philadelphia, set me on my feet and
done everything possible to make a man o' me. I ain't
fit to live!"</p>

<p>"When a man's not fit to live," said Matt, tempted to
be out of patience, "he certainly is not fit to die. Look
this thing square in the face, Cassidy, and live it down."</p>

<p>"But you don't know all I done."</p>

<p>"I guess I do, pretty near."</p>

<p>"No, you don't. I began plannin' to do some underhand
work the minute I heard what the cap'n was going
to do for you. Whenever I git a drink in me, I'm ripe
for anything. That's why I sampled that brandy I was
bringing to the cap'n. I wanted to nerve myself up for
what I was plannin' to do. I listened to you when you
was reading the sealed orders. I heard it all, and I knew
I had something then that was valuable. As soon as you
and Ferral left the <i>Grampus</i>, I got away, too. As I
stepped out o' the sailboat at the landing, this Cap'n
Fingal spoke me. We went into a drinkin' place by the
wharf and we spilled a couple of tots of rum down our
throats. That was enough to set us both going. I told
Fingal what I knowed, and he told me a lot about himself.
He said he'd make it right with me if I could get
you disabled so'st you couldn't manage the <i>Grampus</i>, and
would have to be left behind. That, as Fingal and I both
figgered, would put me in command. It was to handle
you rough, and land you in a hospital, that we trailed
you to the consulate. When we failed there, we come
back to the landing and Fingal says for me to jump
aboard his schooner with him and then lay for the
<i>Grampus</i> up the Izaral. I told Fingal I thought it was
the Rio Dolce, but he laughed and said if you'd read it
that way you was stringing me.</p>

<p>"I was about ready to quit on the business, after what
happened at the consulate, but Fingal got more rum down
me, talked about how I'd been imposed on, and told what
a fine thing it would be if we could make you fail in the
work you had come down here to do.</p>

<p>"That kind of pleased me, too. If I could have fixed
it so you'd fall down on the job the cap'n had laid out
for you, then, I thought, the cap'n would think he had
made a mistake in not putting me up as boss of the submarine.
Funny how a feller's idees will git squeegeed
that away as soon as he gets a little grog under hatches.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, I went with Fingal. We left the
schooner at Port Livingstone, and Fingal told the mate
of the schooner to go down to Barrios and stay there till
Fingal joined him. Then we stole the motor boat and
hustled up the river to that outfit of ragamuffins that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
hopin' to grab the country and turn it over to another dictator.
I was disgusted with the lot of 'em, and with
old Pitou more'n any of the rest. I wouldn't go near
Coleman, and when our information worked out, and
Jordan and the half breed was captured, I felt sore
enough at myself; but it was Speake that cut me up the
worst. Him and me had always been a heap friendly
on the <i>Grampus</i>, and there I was, after betraying him
into the hands of his enemies. Oh, I tell you, Matt, I
felt meechin' enough to go down to the river and jump
in. Then, when old Pitou made up his mind to send
the prisoners down the river in the launch to another
of his hangouts where he thought they'd be safer, and
appointed me as one of the guards to go with 'em and
see that none of 'em got away, I felt about as respectable
as a horse thief. Of course, when you bumped us on
the bottom with the submarine, I couldn't sink into the
river and never come up; oh, no, I just naturally had to
land right on the deck, without so much as getting my
feet wet. I don't know how I ever can go back to Belize
and look the cap'n in the face. That's honest."</p>

<p>Cassidy's regret for what he had done was so profound
that it made a deep impression on Matt.</p>

<p>"You're not a bad fellow at heart, Cassidy," said the
young motorist. "Captain Nemo, Jr., knows that, as well
as all the rest of us. Besides, it was a little bit rough to
jump a fellow like me over the head of an old hand like
you, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wasn't!" growled Cassidy, "not a bit of it!" He
lifted his fierce eyes. "Think I've got the head to do what
you done? No, not in a thousand years. The cap'n
knowed what he was about, and I didn't have sense
enough to see it."</p>

<p>"Well, you buck up and go to the captain. You didn't
cause any great harm, anyhow, the way things have come
out. The captain will be so pleased over what's been
accomplished that he'll overlook a good deal. I'll say a
good word for you, Cassidy."</p>

<p>"You will?" demanded the mate incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a heap more'n I deserve."</p>

<p>"You'll be the mate to help us back to Belize. I'm in
charge until we get there, and I order you to go below
and go on duty."</p>

<p>"Orders is orders, I reckon," and Cassidy hoisted himself
up and followed Matt to the tower hatch and down
into the periscope room. The room was fairly crowded,
and a roar of delight went up at the sight of Matt. It
died away suddenly as Cassidy showed himself. A glitter
came into Speake's eyes as he regarded the mate.</p>

<p>"Better lock Cassidy up somewhere, Matt," suggested
Jordan.</p>

<p>"Yes," grunted Speake venomously, "or tie his hands
and feet an' throw him overboard."</p>

<p>"You're wrong in your drift, friends," said Matt
quietly. "Cassidy is a good fellow at heart, and Fingal
twisted him around his fingers. I haven't any fault to
find with Cassidy, and he's going back to Belize as mate
of the <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>"Avast there, matey!" expostulated Dick. "That's
playing it kind of rough on some of the honest men that
stood by the ship, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Vat a foolishness, Matt!" exploded Carl. "Dot feller
come pooty near being der finish oof you."</p>

<p>"Better think that over a little, Matt," suggested
Jordan.</p>

<p>"Him plaanty bad man," said Tirzal, climbing up into
the tower in order to do his steering from the lookout.</p>

<p>"If he stays, mate, I resign!" snapped Speake.</p>

<p>"No, you don't, Speake!" answered Matt. "I'm master
of this boat until we get back to Belize. Cassidy's
mate, and you're in the torpedo room."</p>

<p>"You see how it is, Matt," muttered Cassidy.</p>

<p>"It's as I want it, Cassidy," said Matt firmly, "as far
as Belize."</p>

<p>"But, look here," began Speake, disposed to argue the
point, "here's a man, holdin' the responsible position of
mate, as goes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget that for a while, Speake," interrupted Matt,
"and remember the number of times Cassidy's pluck and
friendship have been a help to all of us. Put all the fine
things Cassidy has done into one side of the scale, and
this one black mark in the other, and there's still more
than enough left to entitle him to our confidence."</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to you, King," said Cassidy. "I'll go on
as mate as far as Belize, and then the cap'n can settle
the matter as he thinks right. Just now, though, I'm
tired and I guess I'll go to the torpedo room and take a
rest."</p>

<p>"All right," said Matt. "You go to the torpedo room,
too, Speake," Matt added.</p>

<p>Speake hesitated, then followed Cassidy out of the
room.</p>

<p>"You're a queer jigger, Motor Matt," remarked Jordan.</p>

<p>"But he's right, all the same," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Jerry," grinned Jordan, "you stick in your
oar. You're sort o' chesty for a chap that's been stowed
away in the jungle with revolutionists for a couple of
weeks or more, eating mule meat and making all kinds
of trouble for the State Department of your native country,
ain't you? How'd you get run away with, in the
first place?"</p>

<p>"That was too easy, Hays," laughed Coleman. "I
came across from the Pacific to Port Livingstone, and
while I was there the revolutionists gobbled me."</p>

<p>"I believe you said they'd treated you well?"</p>

<p>"The best they could. I played seven-up and picquet
with Pitou, and I learned, before I had been two days
in the rebel camp, that it wasn't safe to beat the general.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
As long as I allowed him to beat me, I was treated to
the best he had. Whenever I beat him, my rations&mdash;even
the mule meat&mdash;were cut down."</p>

<p>Coleman turned to Ysabel, who had been sitting
quietly by.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad, little girl," said he, "that you are
able to get clear of Pitou and Fingal."</p>

<p>"So am I, Mr. Coleman," answered Ysabel. "If it
hadn't been for Motor Matt I'd be still in the camp."</p>

<p>"Motor Matt again!" laughed Coleman.</p>

<p>"Always Motor Matt!" chimed in Jordan, with a quizzical
look at the king of the motor boys.</p>

<p>"He iss der feller vat does t'ings, you bed you," declared
Carl.</p>

<p>"Let's hear about what happened while Speake, Tirzal
and I were away from the boat," suggested Jordan.</p>

<p>"Not now," answered Matt. "I'm hungry, whether the
rest of you are or not. Speake," he called through the
tube leading to the torpedo room, "see if you can rustle
something in the way of breakfast."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," answered Speake heartily.</p>

<p>For some time the <i>Grampus</i> had been heaving and
tossing in a way that made it difficult for those in the
periscope room to keep their seats.</p>

<p>Matt took a look into the periscope.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, "we're out of the river and heading for
Belize."</p>

<p>"And glad I'll be to get back there," remarked Jordan,
with satisfaction. "You've made me a lot of trouble,
Coleman."</p>

<p>"I seem to have made a lot of you a good deal of
trouble," returned Coleman, "and I'm mighty glad I've
ceased to figure as an international issue."</p>

<p>"We all are, for that matter," said Jordan.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DASH OF TABASCO.</p>


<p>In due course the delayed breakfast came up from the
torpedo room. By some error, Speake had mixed an
overdose of tabasco sauce with the canned beans which
he had warmed up on his electric stove.</p>

<p>"Glory!" sputtered Jordan, reaching for water.
"Speake must have mixed a Whitehead torpedo in that
mess of beans."</p>

<p>"Only a dash of tabasco," replied Coleman. "Haven't
you been in Central America long enough to like hot
stuff?"</p>

<p>"Not long enough, anyhow, to acquire an asbestos
stomach. Talking about a dash of tabasco, though,
Motor Matt's raid on the rebels must have been something
of that variety. Reel it off, Matt. We're all good
listeners."</p>

<p>"You do it, Dick," said Matt. "You were with me
and did as much of the work as I did."</p>

<p>"Belay, on that!" remonstrated Dick. "I didn't take
care of Ysabel during that run for the river, did I? And
I didn't get that piece of lead through my arm, either."</p>

<p>"You'd hardly know my arm had stopped a bullet,
would you?" and Matt showed his ability to use his left
hand with the same ease that he did his right.</p>

<p>"Don't sidetrack the relish," chirped Jordan. "Let
Matt's hot work come on with the beans. Go on, Matt&mdash;or
you tell us, Dick, if Matt's too bashful."</p>

<p>Thereupon Dick waded into past events as he and
Matt had experienced them. He slighted his own deeds
to give a greater lustre to Matt's, and finally Matt, in
self-defense, had to take the telling into his own hands
and finish it.</p>

<p>"Well, Jupiter!" exclaimed Jordan, "there's enough
tabasco in that run of work to satisfy almost anybody.
But, if Motor Matt hadn't come up under that launch like
he did, all of us prisoners, my dear friends, would now
be tramping through the jungle toward Pitou's new
camp."</p>

<p>"I'm glad that note of mine proved so valuable to us,"
spoke up Coleman.</p>

<p>"How did you come to lay all that information aboard,
Mr. Coleman?" inquired Dick. "It seemed main queer
that a prisoner could have got wise to all that."</p>

<p>"Pitou told me," said Coleman, with a twinkle in his
eye, "over a game of seven-up. He indulged in liquid
refreshment, as I remember, and the more he beat me,
and the more he indulged, the more confidential he became.
I knew Pedro was a friend of Ysabel's, and that
he was helping her to leave the camp, so I managed to
write down what I had heard, hoping that Ysabel might
get to Port Livingstone and give the news to somebody
there who could and would help us."</p>

<p>"You haven't told us, Mr. Jordan," said Matt, "what
happened to your landing party."</p>

<p>"I hesitate to put it into cold words," answered Jordan,
"after listening to a recital which shows that you
are a general in that sort of affair, Matt, while I am only
a private. By rights, my lad, you are the one who should
have gone with that landing party. However, since it
appears necessary to have our experiences in order to
make the testimony complete, here goes.</p>

<p>"By accident we struck a path. Tirzal said he knew
about the path, but I think the good-natured rascal was
talking for effect, and that he had never seen it before.
I was fairly sure in my own mind, mainly because we had
seen nothing of Fingal's schooner after leaving Belize
nor of a small boat after leaving Port Livingstone, that
Fingal and Cassidy hadn't reached the revolutionists and
told what they knew. I suspect that that's what made
me careless, for I was that when you consider that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
were out on a reconnoitring expedition and ought to
have been looking for traps as well as for revolutionists.</p>

<p>"Well, the trap was sprung at a turn in the path. I
wasn't able to see around the turn, and a bunch of colored
persons in ragged clothes were on us before you
could say Jack Robinson. This happened quite a little
while after we got away from the boat. As I recollect,
we had reconnoitred, and had been led away from the
path on some wild-goose chase or other by Tirzal half a
dozen times. I was just thinking about returning to the
boat when we pushed around that turn.</p>

<p>"I had time to shoot, and it so happened that I wounded
a colored person who was a favorite captain of the general's.
It wasn't a serious wound, but the general was
pretty badly worked up over it, and I didn't know but
they would stand me against a tree and shoot me out of
hand before I could make the general understand I was
in the consular service. At the right moment, Fingal
came up, and he recognized me. The general was tickled,
and felt sure he had enough consular representatives of
the United States in his hands to insure the giving up of
Jim Sixty. Nice business, eh, Coleman," and Jordan
turned aside to his friend, "when it takes two fellows like
you and me to make an even exchange for a fellow like
that filibuster?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered Coleman, "Sixty is worth more to
the rebels than we are. It's what a thing's worth to
somebody else, and not what you think it's worth to you,
that counts."</p>

<p>"The point's too fine and gets away from me," went
on Jordan. "That's about all of it, Matt. Poor Tirzal
was recognized as a spy, and he would have been shot
quick enough if I hadn't threatened the general with all
sorts of things if he carried out his intentions. Out of
consideration for me, Pitou agreed to wait until we got
to the new camp before shooting Tirzal. That's the only
thing, Matt, that saved the half breed's life."</p>

<p>Matt was beginning to feel the effects of his long period
of active duty without sufficient sleep, and he called Cassidy
from the torpedo room, left him in charge of the
<i>Grampus</i>, and then lay down on the locker and was soon
slumbering soundly.</p>

<p>When he was awakened it was by Jordan. It was getting
along toward evening, and the <i>Grampus</i> was anchored
in her old berth off Belize. A sailing ship was
alongside to take the passengers ashore.</p>

<p>Jordan, Coleman, Tirzal, Cassidy and Matt were to
go, and, of course, Ysabel. Dick was left to look after
the submarine.</p>

<p>Ysabel left Matt and the rest at the landing.</p>

<p>"Will I see you again, Matt," she asked, "you and the
rest of the motor boys?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, Ysabel," answered the young motorist,
"but I also hope we won't have such rough times when
our trails cross again."</p>

<p>"Have I helped you enough to offset what I did in
New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"Don't mention that&mdash;forget about it. The account is
more than square."</p>

<p>"Good-by, then," she called, in a stifled voice, and
hurried off along the street.</p>

<p>Jordan and Coleman went on to the house where the
captain had been taken, accompanying Matt and Cassidy.
The mate was going to present himself frankly before the
captain, acknowledge his fault and then abide by the full
consequences.</p>

<p>But fate decreed that the matter should turn out otherwise.</p>

<p>The captain, as it chanced, was very much worse and
was unable to recognize any one. The doctor averred
that the case was not serious, and that, with good nursing,
Captain Nemo, Jr., would pull through all right.</p>

<p>"If he wants a nurse, doctor," said Cassidy, "then it's
up to me. I took care of him in New Orleans, the time
he was sick there, and I guess I can do it now better
than any one else."</p>

<p>"Then pull off your coat," said the doctor, "and go up
to his room."</p>

<p>All this was as it should be. For the present, the
<i>Grampus</i> was still under Matt's care, and he started back
toward the wharf to secure a sailboat and return to the
submarine.</p>

<p>Jordan and Coleman accompanied him part way, then
left him to telegraph their report of recent events to
Washington.</p>

<p>"We're going to handle you and the <i>Grampus</i> without
gloves in that report," declared Jordan, with a wink.</p>

<p>"Just so you please the government and make the navy
department take the submarine off the captain's hands,"
returned Matt, "that's all I care."</p>

<h2><a name="Mischievous_Ned" id="Mischievous_Ned">Mischievous Ned.</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />
<p class="center">By EBEN REXFORD.</p>
<hr class="r5" />


<p>Ned was like most other boys, I suppose. Some days he
felt so good-natured that his spirits were positively "catching,"
as they say about colds and the mumps, and you
couldn't have had the blues if you had made up your mind
to do so, if he was round. But the very next day was apt
to be one of his cross days, and he could be as cross and
disagreeable as any boy ever could.</p>

<p>One morning he got up feeling very much out of sorts.</p>

<p>"Ned's going to be cross to-day," said Harry, when they
gathered round the breakfast table. "It's sticking out all
over him now."</p>

<p>"I don't know as it's any of your business," answered Ned
promptly. "I'd a good deal rather be cross than make a
fool of myself by trying to say smart things when I
couldn't."</p>

<p>Which shot, considering that Harry hadn't tried to say
anything "sharp," was rather uncalled for, and didn't hit
anybody in particular.</p>

<p>"Don't let me hear any more such conversation," said
Mrs. Haynes, taking her seat at the table. "You are both
of you old enough to behave yourselves as gentlemen ought
to."</p>

<p>Ned found any amount of fault with the victuals. The
buckwheat cakes had too much soda in them; the sirup wasn't
fit to eat; the butter looked as if an old squaw had made
it; the potatoes were a little the worst ones he ever tasted.
And the result of his fault-finding was, that he was sent away
from the table with an unsatisfied appetite.</p>

<p>When he was outside the dining room, he realized that,
poor as the breakfast might be, it would have been better
than none, and began to wish he had said less, and eaten
more.</p>

<p>After breakfast the hired girl began to wash the windows.
Ned watched her standing on the stepladder, and thought
what fine fun it would be to tip it over when she was on it,
but concluded he wouldn't try it just then, as Bridget was
apt to be cross as well as himself, and he remembered that
some of the practical jokes he had played off on her had
resulted in tingling ears, and having his ears boxed was
about the worst kind of punishment for Ned. But as Bridget
came out of the sitting room with the stepladder, which she
was taking to the veranda, in order to wash the windows
from the outside, she stumbled over him in the hall, and
came so near falling that she had to let the ladder go and
catch at the stair railing to save herself. And the ladder
in its fall struck against a bracket on which a little vase
stood, and away went both of them, and the vase was
shivered into fragments.</p>

<p>"You good-for-nothin' spalpeen!" cried Bridget, giving
him a slap across the ears; "you got forninst me on purpose,
an' now see what you've done! That illigant mug all
broke to pieces, jist on account of your bad ways. I've a
good mind to tell the missus."</p>

<p>"You needn't 'a' stumbled over me," said Ned angrily. "If
you'd look where you were going, you wouldn't go round
smashing things up in this style. I'd turn you off if I was
in father's place."</p>

<p>"Would you now?" demanded Bridget, her arms akimbo.
"Indade I'd like to see ye doin' it. If you don't take yerself
off, I'll box ye, mind that, now; an' I'll do it up in illigant
style."</p>

<p>Ned concluded that discretion was the better part of valor
at present, and repaired to the veranda.</p>

<p>Presently Bridget came out with the stepladder, which
she adjusted before one of the windows, and then went in
after water.</p>

<p>A bright idea struck Ned. Bridget had been saucy and
impudent. He would be even with her. He'd learn her
to slap his ears!</p>

<p>He pulled a long piece of stout cord out of his pocket
and tied it to one leg of the stepladder, and then hid in
the shrubbery.</p>

<p>Presently out came Bridget. She mounted the ladder, unconscious
of any danger, and began washing the window
vigorously.</p>

<p>All at once the ladder seemed to jerk itself out from
under her, and with a whoop that would have done credit
to any Apache brave, she landed in the middle of a great
lilac bush, before she realized whether her sudden descent
was caused by a collapse of the ladder, an earthquake, or
one of Ned's pranks. She strongly suspected the latter;
but, looking around from her dignified position in the lilac
bush, she could see nothing of him, and there was nothing
about the innocent-looking ladder, as it lay on the ground
at the veranda steps, to indicate that it had been meddled
with. But as she proceeded to alight from her elevated
pedestal, she heard a chuckle somewhere in the shrubbery,
which satisfied her that her suspicions were correct.</p>

<p>Harry came along pretty soon, and wanted Ned to join a
party of children who were going down to the old mill after
berries.</p>

<p>But Ned answered, very shortly, that he "wasn't going
to do any such thing," and Harry went on, without stopping
to coax him any.</p>

<p>That made Ned madder than ever. It was quite evident
that they didn't want him, and only asked him because they
couldn't very well help doing so.</p>

<p>"I'll have some fun with 'em," said Ned, setting off in the
same direction, about half an hour afterward.</p>

<p>The berries the children had gone after grew in an old
meadow. In this old meadow, through which a brook ran,
there was a mill, which was said to be haunted, and every
child was afraid to go near it in the daytime.</p>

<p>Ned picked his way through the bushes on the edge of
the meadow, and got into the mill on the opposite side from
where the children were picking berries.</p>

<p>So busily were they engaged in gathering the ripe fruit
that they were not aware how near they were getting to the
mill, till a sepulchral groan made them look up in undefined
terror, and there, in the farthest shadowy corner, was
something awfully ghost-like.</p>

<p>"Repent of your sins!" exclaimed the ghost, uttering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
first and only thing he could think of; and then, with wild
shouts of fright, the children started off in a stampede for
the road, spilling their berries and tearing their clothes.</p>

<p>Little Susie Mayne lost her sunbonnet, and Will Blake
lost his shoe, but they didn't dare to stop for such trifles.</p>

<p>When they reached the road, panting and breathless, they
looked back, half expecting to see the ghost after them.</p>

<p>But instead of a ghost, there stood Ned, waving a sheet
and apparently highly pleased at the success of his project.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself," shouted
Will Blake. "I'll tell Johnny, an' he'll lick you."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish he could?" answered Ned defiantly. "If
any of you young ones go to being saucy, I'll just come over
there and trounce you."</p>

<p>The children set off toward home, but, coming to another
meadow, where strawberries were quite plenty, they concluded
to stop and fill up their baskets.</p>

<p>"Mr. Belding's awful ugly old cow runs in this meadow,
I heard father say," said Harry. "We'd better keep a lookout
for her."</p>

<p>But in five minutes they had forgotten all about the cow.</p>

<p>Suddenly they all started.</p>

<p>"Moo, moo-o!" sounded in the bushes close by, and they
heard an awful racket as if half a dozen cows were coming.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" screamed all the girls, and made for the
fence, with the boys at their heels.</p>

<p>Susie Mayne tumbled down and bruised her nose so badly
that it bled, and Harry dragged her toward the fence in
anything but a comfortable way.</p>

<p>"I'd be ashamed to run at every little noise before I
knew where it came from," called out Ned, making his
appearance from the bushes. "Cowards! cowards!"</p>

<p>The boys were for clubbing together and giving him a
whipping, but concluded to leave that to the big boys. The
girls all pronounced him, without a single dissenting voice,
to be the "meanest boy they ever heard of," and then they
all went off in high indignation.</p>

<p>Ned climbed up on the fence, and sat there for some time
meditating what to do next. Pretty soon Mr. Belding's
Sammy came along without seeing Ned, and got over into
the meadow, and began picking berries.</p>

<p>Now, Ned hated Sammy Belding, and he thought it would
be fine fun to throw stones at him. He calculated the
chances of getting caught, and concluded if he stayed over
the fence he could get enough start while Sammy was climbing
to take him out of danger. So he filled his pockets with
stones, and began throwing them at Sammy.</p>

<p>At first Sammy looked around in astonishment, and
couldn't make out where they came from. But by and by he
pretended that he was paying no attention to them. But if
you could have looked under his broad-brimmed hat, you
would have seen that he was keeping keen watch.</p>

<p>Ned continued to throw stones. All at once up jumped
Sammy, and made for the fence. Ned was taken entirely by
surprise, but turned to run as soon as he realized that
Sammy had discovered him. But he caught his foot on a
stick, and down he went, and before he got on his feet
Sammy had him, and proceeded to give him a good pounding,
out of which he came with a black eye and a bloody
nose. It was too bad the children couldn't have been there
to see it.</p>

<p>"Throw stones at me again, will you?" said Sammy. "I'll
teach you to mind your own business, if you don't know
how."</p>

<p>Ned went home as soon as Sammy got through with him.
He was hungry, and his whipping had discouraged him
somewhat.</p>

<p>Harry had got home before him, and had reported his bad
conduct. The result was that he was ordered to weed out
three onion beds that afternoon. That made him groan in
spirit. He hated weeding in the garden about the worst of
anything in the world.</p>

<p>But there wasn't any help for it, and he went at it.</p>

<p>The old rooster came along pretty soon. Ned knew he
never did any harm, as he was too well-behaved a bird
to scratch in the garden, but he wanted to vent his spite on
something, so he up with a big stone and shied it at the
rooster's head, not once thinking that it would hit him. But
it did, and with one shrill squawk the fowl gave a leap into
the air, kicked about wildly, and fell dead.</p>

<p>Ned was frightened. What would his father say? He
had been very careful of the rooster, because he came of a
choice breed. What should he do with him? While he
was debating the question with himself, who should come
along but his mother.</p>

<p>"Why, Ned!" exclaimed she, seeing the poor old rooster
lying there, with one claw stretched up pathetically, as if to
call a sympathetic attention to his tragic fate. "How did
this happen?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," began Ned, at a loss for an explanation,
"he came along, and I thought maybe he'd go scratching, and
I shoed him, but he wouldn't go off. Then I threw a stone
that way, and it must have hit him, 'cause&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You weren't afraid he would scratch, because he never
did that," said Ned's mother severely. "I am very sorry
to see you in such a bad temper to-day. Go right up to
the garret and stay there till your father comes home. I
don't know what he will say when he knows of this."</p>

<p>Ned took himself off to the garret, congratulating himself
that that wasn't quite as bad as weeding onions. But he
was terribly troubled about what his father would say. He
couldn't get that out of his mind.</p>

<p>By and by he heard some one coming up the garret stairs.
It sounded like Bridget's steps. A pan stood near by, which
had been placed under a leak in the roof, and was full of
water. Before he stopped to think what the consequence
might be&mdash;he felt so ugly that he didn't care much&mdash;Ned
seized the pan full of water, and just as a head made its
appearance in the shadowy depths of the garret stairway
he let fly pan and all in that direction.</p>

<p>There was an awful spluttering, as if the water had
taken the visitor fairly in the face.</p>

<p>Ned turned pale. It wasn't Bridget, after all, but his
father.</p>

<p>"Young man," said that worthy person, making his appearance,
dripping from head to foot with water, and looking
terribly severe, "I want to see you in the wood shed."</p>

<p>His tone struck terror to Ned's heart. The wood shed, on
such occasions, was quite apt to prove a second inquisition.</p>

<p>Ned followed, not daring to do otherwise. He didn't even
dare to look at his father's face. What took place in the
shed I can't say, but directly after their visit to that part
of the house Ned went to bed, and I hope he got up feeling
better next morning.</p>

<h2><a name="TERRIBLE_FATE_OF_A_DARING_INDIAN" id="TERRIBLE_FATE_OF_A_DARING_INDIAN">TERRIBLE FATE OF A DARING INDIAN.</a></h2>


<p>One of the most remarkable subterranean waterways in
the world was recently discovered in the northern range
of the Rockies in Montana, by the agency of a fatal accident,
witnessed by me on an expedition in which Phil Barnes
and Pierre Leger, two prospectors, were my companions,
together with a Flathead Indian named Klikat.</p>

<p>On October 28, having struck northeast from Bonner's
Ferry into a region entered by a few white men before us,
we found ourselves within twenty-five or thirty miles of the
Canadian boundary, and 7,500 feet above sea level. In front
and on the right were perpendicular cliffs, which barred our
advance. To the left was a precipice about 80 feet high,
overhanging a roaring mountain stream, and extending fully
two miles to the south.</p>

<p>As we stood there, looking around for some opening by
which we might advance, there came to our ears a deep,
roaring sound, alternating in force, stronger and weaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
at intervals of a few seconds. It came in jarring sounds,
with a volume like thunder.</p>

<p>"Me know what him is," said Klikat, with a pleased air
of comprehension. "Him is Big-hole-in-the-water. You
come look," he added, throwing himself flat on the rock with
his head and shoulders hanging over. "Ugh!" he exclaimed,
"Big-hole-in-the-water heap mad to-day. Him funny.
Water go in ground; never come out."</p>

<p>Following Klikat's example, I threw myself on the ground,
and peered down from the dizzy height. Barnes and Leger
did likewise.</p>

<p>It was a curious sight that we beheld. Straight down below
us there was a deep pool, inclosed on three sides by
high walls of eternal rock, thus forming a perpetual barrier
to the passage of the water. The noisy mountain stream
poured great volumes into this natural basin, and then lost
itself. The water in the pool swung round as on a pivot.
In the very centre was a great funnel-shaped "suck-hole,"
fully eight feet across, the water rushing downward with
lightning speed. In the centre of this funnel was a mass
of snow-white foam, dancing and whirling and scattering
flakes of itself around the dark-blue rim of the vortex. At
intervals of fifteen or twenty seconds there would be a
greater downward rush of water, and the pillar of foam
would disappear with the increased speed of the current;
then the roar would increase in volume, another pillar of
foam would form, only to disappear a few moments later
as the previous one had done. It was a grand, a terrible
sight.</p>

<p>As I gazed upon it suddenly there was a low, crumbling
sound, and then a mass of shelving rock right under Klikat
broke loose and fell with a fearful crash. I started to my
feet just as I saw the Indian making frantic efforts to cling
to the edge of the cliff. But his hold was too slight, and,
without uttering word or sound of any kind, Klikat fell
headlong into the mad waters beneath.</p>

<p>Barnes rushed to one of the pack mules for a rope, but
it was too late. Three, four, five times did Klikat swing
around in a spiral course, and then, with a sudden twist, he
shot into the very centre of the vortex. Down he went with
the pillar of foam, out of sight into the bowels of the earth,
and the darkness of death.</p>

<p>The cavity filled with water and was silent. But it was
short satiety. It quickly opened its dark and unfathomable
depths again, and gave out a roaring snore that made the
very mountains tremble.</p>

<p>Cautiously we three withdrew from the edge of the precipice.
We gazed at each other silently and in horror.</p>

<p>Two weeks later we reached the Kootenai country, in
British Columbia, and prepared to camp on the south shore
of Lake Kootenai. It was while in the act of gathering
driftwood along the shore for our first night's supper that
Leger discovered a very ghastly object lying in the water
within six feet of land.</p>

<p>It was the corpse of a man&mdash;an Indian. The face of the
dead was badly bruised and torn, and utterly disfigured.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" cried Barnes, as he cut a ragged cloth from
the neck. "This is a remnant of my silk handkerchief, which
I gave to poor Klikat to cover the gash he cut on his neck
by that dead limb one day&mdash;do you remember? And see!
Right here in this corner is my monogram&mdash;'P. B.'&mdash;worked
in silk."</p>

<p>It was so. We all recognized the silken rag, and we all
knew that the corpse before us was the dead body of Klikat,
who had fallen into the funnel of that awful subterranean
river, fully 250 miles away, far up in the Rockies of Northern
Montana. And yet here was his corpse, drifted ashore
on this lake, between which and the "big-hole-in-the-water"
there is not the slightest connection, so far as mortal eyes
can see. How came he to Lake Kootenai, and how long
had he been there?</p>

<p>We buried poor Klikat on a bit of rising ground about
fifty yards from the lake shore.</p>

<h2><a name="STUMBLING_UPON_GOLD_MINES" id="STUMBLING_UPON_GOLD_MINES">STUMBLING UPON GOLD MINES.</a></h2>


<p>Gold was discovered in California in 1848, and in Colorado
in 1858. The discovery was accidental in both cases, and
the fact created the impression that mines were "lying about
loose." Adventurers drifted about in hopes of stumbling
upon a mine. Here are some instances of lucky finds.</p>

<p>Three men, while looking for gold in California, discovered
the dead body of a man, who evidently had been "prospecting."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," said one of the trio, "he has passed in his
checks."</p>

<p>"Let's give him a decent burial," said another. "Some
wife or mother will be glad if she ever knows it."</p>

<p>They began to dig a grave. Three feet below the surface
they discovered signs of gold. The stranger was buried in
another place, and where they had located a grave they
opened a gold mine.</p>

<p>An adventurer who had drifted to Leadville, awoke one
morning without food or money. He went out and shot a
deer, which, in its dying agonies, kicked up the dirt and
disclosed signs of gold. The poor man staked out a "claim,"
and opened one of the most profitable mines ever worked in
Leadville.</p>

<p>"Dead Man Claim," the name given to another rich mine
in Leadville, was discovered by a broken-down miner while
digging a grave.</p>

<p>A miner died when there were several feet of snow on
the ground. His comrades laid his body in a snow bank
and hired a man to dig a grave. The gravedigger, after
three days' absence, was found digging a mine instead of a
grave. While excavating he had struck gold. Forgetting
the corpse and his bargain, he thought only of the fact that
he had "struck it rich."</p>

<p>An unsuccessful Australian miner went up and down
Colorado for several months "prospecting" for gold, and
finding none. One day he sat down upon a stone, and while
musing over his hard luck, aimlessly struck a stone with his
pick. He chipped off a piece, and sprang to his feet. The
chip was rich with gold quartz.</p>

<p>He hurried into the little town of Rosita, and went to the
assay office, where a teamster had just dumped a load of
wood. He agreed to saw the wood to pay for assaying his
chipped sample. The result of the assay sent him back to
his "claim." When he had taken out of it $500,000, he sold
the mine for $400,000 in cash and $1,000,000 in stock.</p>

<p>But these "stumblings" are the exception to the rule that
mines are found by painstaking, intelligent prospectors. They
spend wearisome months in exploring mountains and gulches.
They are mineralogists, geologists, and, above all, practical
explorers, who can tell from a "twist" in the grain of the
rock, or from the color of a spar seam, whether "paying
gold" can be mined in the region.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="YEAR_OF_THE_COCK" id="YEAR_OF_THE_COCK">YEAR OF THE COCK.</a></h2>


<p>In China and Japan the year 1909 is "the year of the
cock." It is regarded as a lucky year and is symbolized by
a cock sitting on a drum. In statesmanship and literature
this is called "the drum of remonstrance." Formerly such
a drum was to be found in China in front of the imperial
palace, to be struck by an official in charge whenever a
letter of remonstrance was offered to the sovereign. This
practice is said to have originated with Emperor Yao, a benevolent
ruler who reigned from 2357 to 2285 B. C. His
reign and that of Emperor Shun, who succeeded him, constituted
a "golden age" of China.</p>

<p>It is believed by the Japanese that the cock has five virtues.
His comb represents civilization and his strong feet
denote military power. When he meets an enemy he fights
well, thus demonstrating courage. When he finds food he
calls friends, thereby showing himself kind and helpful. He
keeps watch for the dawn, thus proving himself faithful.</p>

<p class="bb center huge">MOTOR STORIES</p>


<p>The boys who want to learn something from what they read, as
well as to be interested by it, will never find another publication
that will satisfy them so well as MOTOR STORIES. "Motor
Matt" is not an impossible boy character. He is simply a youth who
has had considerable training in a machine shop where motors of all
kinds were repaired, and who is possessed of a genius for mechanics.
His sense of right and wrong is strongly developed, and his endeavors
to insure certain people a square deal, lead him into a series of the
most astonishing, but at the same time the most natural adventures
that ever befell a boy.</p>
